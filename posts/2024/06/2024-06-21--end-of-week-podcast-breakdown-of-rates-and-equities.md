I wanted to take the time to further explain the dynamics in the equity report I published for you. I recorded a screen share podcast explaining the report and sharing some macro charts. For context, here are the articles I referenced:

*   Equity Report: [Link](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/equity-report-where-is-the-s-and)
    
*   Equities are going to Melt UP published in January 2024: [Link](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/macro-insightsreport-the-next-move)
    
*   Interest Rate Strategy and Report: [Link](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/interest-rate-report-strategy-and-7ab)
    
*   Interest Rate Primer: [Link](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/interest-rates-primer)
