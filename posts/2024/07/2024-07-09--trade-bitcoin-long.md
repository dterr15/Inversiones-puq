Hello everyone,

I have laid out how this week and the month of July are likely to play out given the macro skew and catalysts.

We are likely to see risk assets rally as we see a bull steepening into positive real growth. In other words, when the price of money drops in the system and growth remains constant, assets are the release valve to price this difference. The implication is we are likely to rally in assets across the risk curve.

We are currently at $57,150 in Bitcoin right now. We have had some short-term idiosyncratic catalysts cause selling pressure in Bitcoin. However, the macro liquidity backdrop remains incredibly accommodative. I am opening a long here with stops at $50,600.

As we move through CPI this week, we are likely to see a very clear confirmation or falsification of the trade. Fundamentally, asset prices remain skewed to the upside.
