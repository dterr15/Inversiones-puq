Hello everyone (important announcement about pricing in this article!),

As you know, the [Capital Flows](https://open.substack.com/pub/capitalflows) Substack continues to move forward with unparalleled intensity in research, trades, and even the cultural flair of Pepe’s and AI art. I started this Substack with two main ideas:

*   _“You wasted $150,000 on an education you coulda got for $1.50 in late fees at the public library.”_
    
*   _In the information age, you simply need to be at the right place, at the right time, with the right information to succeed_

While colleges and institutions are failing, people are acquiring knowledge from those who actually have competence in a domain instead of ivory-tower academics. This is exactly why I started the Substack with educational primers on every major part of global macro.

Everyone knows I am an active practitioner in financial markets sharing real-time macro trades instead of pontification about the way the world “should be.” I am going to continue putting out rigorous research and generating alpha. I want to make sure everyone is on board for the ride and no one is left behind.

If you want to see the current trades I am running, check them out here ([Link](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/trades-summary-end-of-week) and [Link](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/week-ahead-fomc-trade)). My strategy opened the bond long and S&P500 (ES futures) long when market sentiment was full of uncertainty:

ES long was opened here: [Link](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/trade-opening-eca) (see my previous ES trade I held for 2 months during the bull market this year: [Link](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/trade-closing-es-long))

You can start a free trial on the Substack and pay nothing to review all of the trades and research I have provided (this means you have zero downside and unlimited upside). The main point is that I am contextualizing each trade with the WHY behind the trade. This means each trade is backed by research that equips you to get better and better at analyzing global macro. We won’t always get it right but we will know exactly what to do in the current moment to generate risk-adjusted returns (see my podcast on this: [Link](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/macro-podcast-how-to-generate-exceptional)).

Everyone who is currently a Paid Subscriber has access to all of the in-depth macro research and trades at the current price ($60/month or $720/year). This price will never change for you. In order to continue future innovation and the quality of research, the price for new subscribers will be increasing.

**This price will be increasing to $70/month or $840/year on Monday, August 5th. If you subscribe BEFORE then, you will lock in the lower price ($60/month or $720/year) and never pay more than this. If you are here early and long the Capital Flows Substack, then you get to lock in the lower price for all the future upside.**

The quality of research on the Substack will only get better and the alpha sharing won’t stop! As “Economists” continue floundering with their calls about recessions or meltups, we will continue to generate alpha as we manage the risks incrementally and have an actual view of what is taking in the economy and financial markets.

We move forward together frens! Fortune favors the brave
