Hello everyone,

We are back with another macro podcast on how the speed of changes in growth, inflation, and liquidity connect to the speed of market returns. If you missed the two previous macro podcasts I did they are here:

*   [Macro Podcast: Carry and Risk Premias](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/macro-podcast-carry-and-risk-premias)
    
*   [Macro Podcast: How to generate exceptional returns](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/macro-podcast-how-to-generate-exceptional)
    
*   [Reading, Research and Being Exceptional](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/reading-research-and-being-exceptional?utm_source=publication-search)
    

As a reminder, the price increase will take place this Monday, August 5th. I will be releasing the macro report this weekend so it will be a great time to do a free trial at the very least. Please see all the details here:

All of the educational primers are here:

Enjoy the podcast!
