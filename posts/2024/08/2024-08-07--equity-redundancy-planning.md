Hello everyone,

I have laid out my equity view very clearly in the following reports:

*   [Comprehensive Macro Report](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/comprehensive-macro-report-5fd)
    
*   [Capitulation: Equities and Rates](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/capitulation-equities-and-rates)
    
*   [Positioning Unwind And The Next Trade](http://Positioning Unwind And The Next Trade)
    

I want to expand on several tensions given the equity price action today.

First, there are clearly several scenarios for equities here:

*   Bullish: We can move higher as implied vol premiums unwind and the macro backdrop supports a bullish equity view.
    
*   Bearish and Lower: We can move lower if the VIX blows out again and short vol has to unwind their positioning.
    

I want to break down the tensions for these because we are at a mini inflection point.
