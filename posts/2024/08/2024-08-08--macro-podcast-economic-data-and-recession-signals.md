It is important to see the data as is and not how it must be interpreted based on our biases. My introduction to markets and economics was caught by the attention of economic doomers like the Money GPS, Peter Schiff and all those guys. While I learned a lot, unfortunately I was led to fear markets and high growth sectors because of the impending world ending yada yada and I missed a huge bull run because of it. I'm glad I've found more level headed people like you, Brent Johnson and a few others who don't scare you into buying their gold.
