The entire point of trading is extracting returns due to the uncertainty around outcomes. The views I laid out about the growth scare and interest rate cuts are now being repeated by the mainstream consensus economists AFTER the fact.

Where does this leave us now? Well, what happened last week sets the context for updated views moving into the week ahead. If you didn’t understand all the moving parts of asset prices from last week, check out the video I posted on Twitter. The link is in this chat:

Keep in mind that the last CPI and PPI prints set short term tops and bottoms in the ranges for OHLC levels on a daily basis:
