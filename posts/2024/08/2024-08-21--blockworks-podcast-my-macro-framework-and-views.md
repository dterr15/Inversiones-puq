Hello everyone,

I am excited to announce that I did my first podcast on Blockworks explaining my macro framework and views for where we are in the cycle:

Since I explained a lot of the trades and views in this, I decided to take the paywall off the comprehensive macro report I wrote several weeks ago. This was where I laid out my view on equities and interest rates. This was incredibly relevant at the time of publication because equities were at lows. I will be writing an updated report for Paid Subscribers in the coming weeks. (You can reference this article as well on the equity long: [Link](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/positioning-unwind-and-the-next-trade))

My view on Bitcoin remains the same and I published an entire Twitter thread that can be found here: [Link](https://x.com/Globalflows/status/1824147432965583038)

If you want to learn more about my framework or see the educational articles, here are the main ones I would reference you to:

I want to take a moment to personally thank Felix and Blockworks for having me on the podcast, I would encourage you to follow their work and newsletter:
