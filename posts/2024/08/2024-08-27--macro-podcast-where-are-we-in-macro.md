I recorded a podcast covering the following topics:

*   Are we in a recession?
    
*   What is the deal with credit risk and defaults?
    
*   What is the deal with the yield curve?
    
*   Is something going to “blow up” and cause the system to collapse?
    
*   What are the fundamental principles for making decisions when everyone has no clue what they are doing?
    

Here is the macro report I referenced:
