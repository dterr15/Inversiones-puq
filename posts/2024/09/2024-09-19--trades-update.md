FOMC and the rhetoric of Powell fall directly in line with the monetary inflection event of Jackson Hole that was laid out in the previous macro report ([link](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/macro-report-updated-view-on-interest)). The explicit statements Powell made about the future of monetary policy will interact with the current Goldilocks impulse to fuel the current trades that are opened on the Substack.

There will be a comprehensive macro report published tomorrow breaking down all the tensions in economic data and HOW it connects to financial markets. This would be a great time to do a free trial if you are a free subscriber because tomorrow is the last day to lock in the current rate before the pricing increases (all info about the direction of the Substack and pricing is here: [Link](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/forging-ahead-the-future-of-macro)).

As expected, we saw hedges unwind in equities. In the overnight session, US equities and specifically the Nikkei rallied considerably. This pushed the ES trade that was opened further onside ([link](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/trade-opening-80e)).

It also pushed the BTC long that was opened considerably onside ([link](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/trade-opening-80e)):

ZN bounced right off the buy zone that was noted in the alpha report ([link](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/alpha-report-factor-moves-and-interest)):
