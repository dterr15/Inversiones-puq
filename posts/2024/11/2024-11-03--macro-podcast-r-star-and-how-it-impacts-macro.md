We are going to dig deeper into this idea of “R-Star” because it contextualizes WHY interest rates have varying degrees of impact on the economy and financial markets. Why did rate hikes before the GFC cause delinquencies to rise, but we aren’t seeing the same thing now? Why has the curve uninverted, and equities are still hitting all-time highs? **All of these things become very clear if you understand the underlying mechanics of the system as they connect to R-Star.**

All of this is laid out in the macro podcast below: Enjoy!
