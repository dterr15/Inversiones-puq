I want to provide a brief reminder about how the research on the Substack functions, summarize the recent macro pieces, and then go over the current open trades.

All of the macro research falls under these three categories on the main page ([link](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/)). If you are a new subscriber, I would encourage you to review all recent pieces so that you are aware of WHERE we are in the macro regime and WHY the specific trades are being run. You can also review the “About” section explaining each of these categories here: [Link](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/about)

The most recent comprehensive macro report was published yesterday and it breaks down the current skew in both interest rates and equities:
