The updated macro rate matrix dashboard has been released with data on JOLTS, NFP, and Durable goods. In this video, I will break down the updated spreadsheet and share how the data informs the developments that are taking place in the macro environment. (YouTube [Link](https://youtu.be/e_mvelaE1vU))

The comprehensive macro report will be published for paid subscribers in the next couple of days. Now would be a great time to do a free trial so you can review all the paid research and read the coming macro report ([link](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/5cf14480)). Feel free to send me a message with any questions.

Updated Spreadsheet!

Updated Macro Tear Sheets:

As always, a Pepe for the culture!
