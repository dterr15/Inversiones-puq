As we move into the CPI print this week, it is important to have a clear view of WHAT is happening in order to properly plan for the distribution of outcomes.

The educational primer on this topic is here:

The Macro Rate Matrix Dashboard has been updated with the CPI and PCE data. All of the models are in one place for you. (Analysis using the dashboard is below):

All of the Macro Tear Sheets on Fixed Income, Equities, Crypto, FX, and Commodities have been updated as well:

All of the macro views have been laid out in the recent report:

The updated Excel model now has a tab with inflation metrics and there are several things I want to point out as we move into this CPI print.

First, the broad rate of change for YoY core CPI remains skewed to the downside but we are slowing LESS than a year ago:

This is why understanding the CPI print this week is important.
