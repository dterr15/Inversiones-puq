We have a special podcast today with my friend Josh Schultz who is one of the few people who consistently applies a macro playbook to running businesses through the manufacturing and inventory cycle. In this podcast, we cover the lessons he learned from his time in the financial industry and how he applied those to build systematic playbooks that scale small businesses.

I would strongly encourage you to take the time to listen to the podcast and follow Josh on [Twitter](https://x.com/joshuamschultz) and his [newsletter.](https://www.joshuaschultz.com/newsletter)

Enjoy! ([YouTube Link](https://youtu.be/uNtfp5Ks-dU))
