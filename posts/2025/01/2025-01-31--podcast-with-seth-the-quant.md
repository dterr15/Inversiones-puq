I recorded a really fun podcast with Seth The Quant who I go back and forth with on Twitter. If you are trying to understand momentum and mean reversion in financial markets, this is a great place to start. Enjoy!

Be sure to follow his substack [Seth Rosenthal](https://open.substack.com/users/31207487-seth-rosenthal?utm_source=mentions)

I also recorded a podcast with the guys at Milk Road which is always fun:

Cheers
