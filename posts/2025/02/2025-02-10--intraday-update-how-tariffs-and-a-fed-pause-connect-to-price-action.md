Why does this matter? Because it is going to drag on the long end and cause the curve to steepen.

We are seeing bear steepening on the day with crude up on the day as well:

The context for this move was laid out in the macro report:

And the video breakdown:

We are now below the NFP level and likely to retrace marginally as we move into the CPI print. This is going to cause the curve to bear steepen as the Fed holds rates constant.

As I have stated in the macro report, the Fed pause is directly connected to the scenario analysis we have for the curve now:
