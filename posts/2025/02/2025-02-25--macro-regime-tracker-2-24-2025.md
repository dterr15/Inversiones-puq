Since Trump won the election in November of 2024, equity markets have been range-bound as the Fed has paused. Significant underlying rotations are taking place as the market is grinding in a range which means watching underlying equity sectors through positioning shocks carries outsized significance.

*   US Equities closed negative on the day with tech as the worst-performing sector. Part of this is due to the weaker response to earnings prints in the technology sector.
    
*   “\*TRUMP: TARIFFS ON CANADA, MEXICO WILL GO FORWARD” - Tariff headlines continue to create marginal volatility in the FX market as bonds catch a marginal bid.
    
*   “\*FED'S GOOLSBEE STILL SUPPORTS WAIT-AND-SEE ON TRUMP POLICIES”: Bull flattening continues to take place into Fed comments.
    
*   Alibaba’s U.S.-traded ADRs sank 10% on Monday, while the Nasdaq Golden Dragon index slid 5%—its worst drop since October. Although the White House partially walked back Trump’s tariff threats, Asian markets must still reprice trade-war risk. With the Bank of Korea expected to cut rates, investors should prepare for deeper volatility in the Asia session.
