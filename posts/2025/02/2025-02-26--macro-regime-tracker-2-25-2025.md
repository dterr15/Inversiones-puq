Since Trump’s victory in November 2024, equity markets have been range-bound as the Fed maintains its pause. Beneath this sideways grind, significant sector rotations continue—underscoring the importance of closely monitoring positioning shocks in key industries.

*   **US Equities** finished lower, with technology posting the steepest losses.
    
*   **Growth-Scare Narrative Intensifies**: equities extended losses while Treasuries rallied, and February’s weaker-than-expected consumer confidence reading added another data point suggesting policy uncertainty is dragging on economic sentiment.
    
*   **Treasury Rally**: A strong five-year auction provided additional support for bonds, bolstered by comments from Treasury Secretary Bessent indicating the administration’s desire to drive yields and the dollar lower.
    
*   **Rising Rate-Cut Expectations**: Mounting nervousness around the health of the U.S. economy continues to fuel Fed rate-cut bets.
    
*   **Fed Policy Outlook**:
    
    *   _BARKIN: FED POLICY MAY NEED TO 'LEAN AGAINST' HEADWINDS_
