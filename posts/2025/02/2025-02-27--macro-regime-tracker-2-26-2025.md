While Trump’s victory in November 2024 seems like forever ago, equity markets have been range-bound as the Fed maintains pauses. Beneath this sideways grind, sector rotations continue underscoring the importance of closely monitoring positioning shocks in industries.

*   **Equities**: Markets remain range-bound, though defensive sectors (health care, staples, energy) led the latest decline. Tech names, by contrast, eked out gains.
    
*   **Tariff Uncertainty**: Trump’s threat of tariffs on Mexico and Canada had a muted impact on the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso, suggesting skepticism they’ll be imposed. However, if enacted, both currencies could drop further.
    
    *   \*TRUMP: EU TARIFFS TO BE 25% ON AUTOS, OTHER THINGS
        
    *   \*TRUMP SAYS CANADA, MEXICO TARIFFS GO INTO EFFECT APRIL 2
        
*   **Copper Probe**: The Commerce Department investigation could lead to copper tariffs; prices rallied on the announcement and ongoing supply disruptions in Chile.
    
*   **Nvidia**: Data-center revenue surged 93% from a year earlier, though EPS growth slowed. Shares moved higher in after-hours trading at about 30x forward earnings, in line with other tech giants.
    
*   **Fed & Rates**: A strong Treasury auction and mounting economic worries are fueling bets on potential rate cuts. Fed officials remain wary of disentangling policy-driven inflation from broader supply factors.
    
    *   US Fed will 'adapt' to any policy changes, Chicago's Goolsbee says.
        
*   **Outlook**: Lingering policy uncertainty and uneven corporate results keep markets on edge. The defensive tilt may persist until there’s greater clarity on tariffs, trade, and the Fed’s path forward.
    
    *   \*TRUMP CONFIRMS ZELENSKIY TO VISIT THE US ON FRIDAY
