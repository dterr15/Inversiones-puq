While Trump’s victory in November 2024 seems like forever ago, equity markets are starting to bleed, now at 6 consecutive down days (ES futures). Sector rotations continue underscoring the importance of closely monitoring positioning shocks in industries and in related derivatives (options, fx forwards etc..)

Equities

*   Range-Bound but Volatile: The S&P 500 erased YTD gains and the Nasdaq 100 hit November lows. Defensive sectors led declines; tech fared better early on, but Nvidia plunged over 8% post-earnings.
    
*   CTA Flows: Rapid selling into the close suggests commodity trading advisors drove the final leg down, with megacaps leading losses.
    

Tariff Uncertainty

*   Canada & Mexico: Tariffs will proceed on March 4, threatening downside for the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso if fully enacted.
    
*   EU Autos: Trump maintained a possible 25% tariff, keeping trade tensions high.
    

Copper Probe

*   The Commerce Department’s copper investigation could lead to new tariffs. Existing supply disruptions in Chile are already boosting prices.
    

Fed & Rates

*   Mixed Signals: Economic worries and a strong Treasury auction fuel rate-cut bets, but Fed officials (Barkin, Schmid, Hammack, Harker) remain cautious. Chicago Fed’s Goolsbee says the Fed can “adapt” if conditions change.
    
*   Sticky Inflation: Policymakers warn supply-driven price pressures aren’t fully resolved.
    

Tomorrow

*   Consumer Data & PCE Inflation on Friday will be crucial. Any sign of weakening consumer activity could compound existing market jitters.
    
*   Additionally we have the month end option expires to navigate.
