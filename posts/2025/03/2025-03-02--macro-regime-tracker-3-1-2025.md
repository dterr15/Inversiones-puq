*   **Stagflation Fears on the Rise**: Recent data reveals a troubling mix of slowing economic growth and stubbornly high inflation, sparking concern among analysts.
    
*   **Consumer Spending Dips Maginally**: Americans tightened their wallets in January, marking the steepest monthly decline in nearly four years and creating questions about the broader economy.
    
*   **Tariff Turbulence**: Businesses large and small warn that higher import taxes are driving up costs, with industries from autos to food feeling the pinch.
    
*   **Fed’s Dilemma**: The central bank must balance reining in inflation against supporting the labor market—an especially tough challenge if growth continues to weaken.
    

More….

*   The latest charts and proprietary models suggest we’re entering a new regime, and the grip on U.S. economic “exceptionalism” is loosening. Next week’s data will bring labor into the mix, where recent growth figures, equity rotations, and flashing technical warnings underscore a volatile outlook. March is shaping up to be a wild ride!
