We are likely approaching a cyclical inflection point in the macro regime. The new political administration is well on its way to implementing tariffs, which is being reflected in inflation and the decisions of corporations. Within this period of time, we are likely to see overextrapolations of inflation risk and recession risk. The market is currently overextrapolating the recession risk as reflected in positioning in both stocks and bonds. The main developments in this regime are as follows:

*   President Trump announced new tariffs on Canada and Mexico, effective Tuesday, and doubled a tariff on China to 20%
    
*   He signaled tariffs on “external” agricultural products starting April 2, sparking fears of a broader trade war
    
*   Canada and Mexico prepared retaliatory measures while US markets slumped and inflation concerns grew
    
*   The administration’s moves could disrupt supply chains, particularly in the auto and agriculture sectors
    
*   Economists warned that escalating tariffs may further weaken US economic growth and raise consumer prices
