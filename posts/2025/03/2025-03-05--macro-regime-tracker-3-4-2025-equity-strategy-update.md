We are in a macro regime where short-term data releases and news headlines are shocking positioning within the broader constraints of the macro regime. Significant focus has been on Trump’s tweets and Scott Bessents’ recent comments about the market. While these short-term news releases might shock the market intraday, the macro constraints in the system will continue to exert themselves as the timeframe moves to multi-day and weekly returns.

*   Equtiy internals (breadth) and vol measures continue to move to extremes. These are directly connected to the dynamics we are seeing in the SOFR pricing for 2025 and yield curve regimes.
    

FOMC (NY) President John Williams noted they are watching the increase in long term inflation expectations but highlighted that survey data still points to short-term price concerns as the primary area. Williams acknowledged that tariffs might contribute to higher consumer costs. He said the central bank will stay attentive to economic data and business sentiment, adding that the current monetary policy stance remains appropriate.

*   President Trump announced new tariffs on Canada and Mexico, effective Tuesday, and doubled a tariff on China to 20%
    
*   \*WILLIAMS: INFLATION EXPECTATIONS SOMETHING TO WATCH CLOSELY
