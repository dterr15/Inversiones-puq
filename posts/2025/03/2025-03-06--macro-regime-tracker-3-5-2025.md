The S&P 500 closed up 1.1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 climbed 1.4%, hoping that trade-related disruptions might ease in the near term.

Broader market dynamics remain anchored in a macro regime where short-term data releases and headline-driven events such as Trump’s tweets and Lutnick’s tariff remarks can produce sudden intraday shocks.

\*LUTNICK: TRUMP CANADA, MEXICO DECISION EXPECTED THIS AFTERNOON

\*LUTNICK: SOME RECIPROCAL TARIFFS WILL COME ON RIGHT AWAY

While these developments can move the market on a day-to-day basis, the structural constraints of the economic environment reassert themselves over multi-day and weekly horizons. Against this backdrop, investors are now watching a slate of upcoming economic reports and central-bank commentary for longer-term direction, even as near-term volatility persists.

We have to digest ECB tomorrow (6th), NFP later this week (7th) and the BoC (12th) next week.. shortly followed by FOMC (19th), BoJ(19th), BoE(20th) and the SNB(20th).

> _**The Macro Regime Model first provides a real-time view of growth and inflation dynamics, then directly connects these insights to upcoming catalysts and the statistical measures that gauge their impact on asset prices.**_
