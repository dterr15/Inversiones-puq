_**The Macro Regime Tracker offers a daily lens on how shifts in growth, inflation, and liquidity affect short-term risk and reward. Leveraging machine learning and cross-asset data, it identifies macro changes and their impact on market positioning.**_

The launch video for the Macro Regime Tracker is here: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wToX5cb-ZY)

The macro context was laid out in the comprehensive macro report published this morning:

As the macro report laid out, the primary dynamic we are experiencing is a rotation connected to carry trades. The tensions with China and the rotation are directly connected. The headlines should be interpreted through the framework laid out in the macro report.

*   President Trump's comments about an economic "transition" were interpreted as increasing the likelihood (and acceptability) of a recession.
    
*   Despite increased caution, current market pricing—both Fed rate-cut expectations and 10-year yields—reflects anticipation of an economic slowdown rather than a full-blown recession.
    
*   February's inflation report (alongside the January JOLTs report) emerges as the next critical driver of risk sentiment. A softer or inline inflation reading could revive optimism around a responsive Fed, while a hotter print risks deeper equity weakness and further yield curve flattening.
