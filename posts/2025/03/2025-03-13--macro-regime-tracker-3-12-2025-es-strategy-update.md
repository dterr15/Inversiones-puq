_**The Macro Regime Tracker offers a daily lens on how shifts in growth, inflation, and liquidity affect short-term risk and reward. Leveraging machine learning and cross-asset data, it identifies macro changes and their impact on market positioning.**_

The launch video for the Macro Regime Tracker is here: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wToX5cb-ZY)

We are approaching an extreme in positioning within the macro constraints of the regime. Positioning is about the price that you pay for exposure to the macro regime. On a fundamental basis, you need a shift in the actual constraints of the macro regime to have persistent moves in things like the VIX or credit spreads. The logic for thinking about this relationship between the macro regime and positioning is laid out in the Macro Alpha Primers that can be found here:

The macro regime has been laid out in the most recent macro report here:

You will notice that the majority of news about tariffs is beginning to have less and less of an impact on markets which is partially due to the wider ranges we are seeing AND the uncertainty being priced in.

*   \*TRUMP REITERATES HE WILL DO RECIPROCAL TARIFFS
    
*   \*TRUMP: PEOPLE GOING TO RUSSIA NOW, HOPE WE CAN GET CEASEFIRE
    
*   \*TRUMP CALLS LATEST INFLATION NUMBERS VERY GOOD NEWS
    
*   \*SHEINBAUM: MEXICO NOT RESPONDING NOW TO STEEL, ALUMINUM TARIFFS
    
*   \*BANK OF CANADA CUTS KEY RATE 25 BPS TO 2.75%, MATCHING EST.
    
*   \*LUTNICK: WILL BRING TARIFFS DOWN IF OTHER COUNTRIES DO SAME
    
*   \*TRUMP TOLD BOWMAN SHE WILL BE VICE CHAIR FOR FED: FOX BUSINESS

*   \*ECB'S SIMKUS: WILL SEE IN APRIL IF WE CUT OR PAUSE
