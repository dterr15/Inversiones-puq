While implied volatility ended marginally higher today, we are below the 30 level as bonds are in a range post the CPI print.

We are likely to see bonds marginally lower as we move into FOMC next week. Positioning is already preparing for Powell:

As bonds are in their range and the VIX closed below 30 today, the carry trade closed HIGHER. This was one of the main drivers for the sell-off in equities.

The ES strategies at the end of this report continue to show the incremental skew that is taking place and is dynamically updating every day. More on this at the end of the report.

We are now seeing government officials openly talk about recession and a lower stock market. While these news releases have minimal impact on weekly returns for equities and bonds, it illustrates where the narrative is beginning to diverge from reality. At the beginning of this year, the narrative was that the Trump economy would be the best in history in spite of higher rates and high valuations in equities. We are now seeing the opposite as the standard deviation of price away from analyst expectations has gone to a short-term extreme.

Remember, these politicians are feeding the market a narrative for their purposes, NOT to help you!
