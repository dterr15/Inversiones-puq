_**The Macro Regime Tracker offers a daily lens on how shifts in growth, inflation, and liquidity affect short-term risk and reward. Leveraging machine learning and cross-asset data, it identifies macro changes and their impact on market positioning.**_

The launch video for the Macro Regime Tracker is here: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wToX5cb-ZY)

The most important thing I want to emphasize about today’s macro context is the difference between a rotation of capital and an actual recession in the underlying economy. When we look at US equities, they are currently in a -10% drawdown but one of the primary drivers has been a rotation into Chinese Tech and European banks. If the current pullback in equities was only from a contraction in US growth then we would see much higher credit spreads and more deterioration in issuance. I laid out these tensions in the two recent reports:

*   [Alpha Report: Credit Risk and Recession Risk In The US](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/alpha-report-credit-risk-and-recession)
    
*   [How Much Risk Is Priced In Markets?](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/how-much-risk-is-priced-in-markets)
    

The main idea is that until we see more red flags from credit markets, a recession isn’t on the table. This means the drivers for any further downside in equities will be from the carry trade and a rotation of capital on an international basis.

This is the exact reason we saw the DAX (blue) and European financials (white) UP as US equities (orange) closed the day down. Capital has been moving OUT of the US and into Europe and China.

This is WHY yields in Germany (white) have been rallying and yields in the US remain flat:

This is also why banks like Deutsche Bank is melting up:
