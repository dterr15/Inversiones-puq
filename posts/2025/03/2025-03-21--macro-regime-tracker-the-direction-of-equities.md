**Main Idea: ES just moved to an implied volatility discount as the index is still below the 5,700 level. The fact that implied volatility has moved back to a discount without ES rallying above the 5,800 level is a clear indication that important macro drivers are in play and need to be monitored closely. Watching Chinese equities during the Asia session and Eurostoxx during the London session will be critical given the rotation out of US equities and into these other countries.**
