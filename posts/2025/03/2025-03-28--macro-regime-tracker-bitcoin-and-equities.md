_**The Macro Regime Tracker offers a daily lens on how shifts in growth, inflation, and liquidity affect short-term risk and reward. Leveraging machine learning and cross-asset data, it identifies macro changes and their impact on market positioning.**_

The launch video for the Macro Regime Tracker is here: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wToX5cb-ZY)

One of the major themes I have laid out for paid subscribers is that macro volatility is NOT over. Notice that 30D volatility remains elevated as 10D volatility is falling marginally. This means on a 30D basis, the drivers in equities to the downside have been significant enough to push equities outside of their historical range. The short-term capitulation has subsided as equities bounced but the bounce has been incredibly weak and macro factors arent shifting enough to justify a shift back to all time highs and low volatility.

As a result, ALL risk assets, including Bitcoin, have wider ranges. As I laid out in the Twitter thread today ([link](https://x.com/Globalflows/status/1905343513971310915)), implied volatility for the major BTC proxies (MSTR and COIN) has moved to an implied volatility discount. We don’t know when things are going to begin to shift back to the upside on a macro and positioning basis but for now, there remains reasonable risks to the downside in Bitcoin and equities.
