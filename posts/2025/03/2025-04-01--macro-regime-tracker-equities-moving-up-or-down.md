_**The Macro Regime Tracker offers a daily lens on how shifts in growth, inflation, and liquidity affect short-term risk and reward. Leveraging machine learning and cross-asset data, it identifies macro changes and their impact on market positioning.**_

The launch video for the Macro Regime Tracker is here: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wToX5cb-ZY)

*   Macro Regime Context
    
*   Macro Tear Sheets: Equities, Fixed Income, FX, Crypto, and Commodities
    
*   Macro Regime Dashboard: Excel spreadsheet for economic data and interest rates
    
*   Growth and Inflation Regime Tracker
    
*   Fixed Income and Credit Model
    
*   Equity Sector Model
    
*   Machine Learning Strategies and Models
    

The structural changes that are taking place in AI will always incrementally reveal themselves in price action.

As Soros lays out in his book on reflexivity, the market will always test the underlying trend. When we decompose this logic into the actual drivers of markets, we know that positioning is oversold, and there are some macro risks. We have yet to make a durable bottom in equities, but this could change at any time.

As I have consistently laid out in the trade write-ups and alpha reports, we are unlikely to price more than 75bps in Z5, which means the forward curve is unlikely to price the Fed cutting more than 75bps between now and the next FOMC meeting. We saw this tangibly take place as the Z5 SOFR contract retraced from its intraday high at the same time ES rallied from its low:

I explained the logic behind these flows as they connect to EURUSD in this report:

I am NOT overly concerned about the structural dynamics in the macro regime right now. There is going to be significant volatility and rotations, but we are not seeing the type of evidence that would elicit a structure deleveraging. Mapping the incremental changes in the macro regime as they connect to positioning is THE goal in this regime. However, you don’t want to let this short term goal distract you from recognizing that credit is still flowing to the US economy and AI is shifting productivity and consumption patterns in a manner that could turn out to be greater than COVID-19.

Much of this risk has concentrated in the Mag7 names as the carry trade unwinds which is why implied correlation has remained elevated. As long as implied correlation remains elevated, equal weight SPX will outperform the index (RSP/SPY ratio)
