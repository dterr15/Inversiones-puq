_**The Macro Regime Tracker offers a daily lens on how shifts in growth, inflation, and liquidity affect short-term risk and reward. Leveraging machine learning, AI, and cross-asset data, it identifies macro changes and their impact on market positioning.**_

You can find the video I recorded here that explains the new models and drivers ([link](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/special-announcement-new-bitcoin))

When we have such wide ranges in risk assets, it is critical to maintain the big picture. I want to lay out the main structural forces and then connect them to the cyclical changes we are seeing and then zoom all the way down to the short-term levels in assets.

**Main Idea:** As we came into this year, it was clear that macro risks were beginning to shift. Positioning and consensus were offside as Trump took office, and everyone was extrapolating the “Trump economy” as equity valuations were at ATHs. There are two major forces to consider in this regime: 1) the political administration with tariff risk and 2) the Fed’s aggressiveness in cutting.

Remember, the Fed’s actions are the linchpin for all domestic liquidity. When inflation (blue and orange in chart below) is accelerating and ABOVE Fed Funds, capital rushes out the risk curve. Why? Because the market prices BOTH nominal and real risk, we typically only think of the world in nominal numbers. The situation we are at now is highly consequential because the Fed is holding rates above inflation.

The stance of the Fed, in addition to tariff risks, has put downward pressure on equities.

We know that the aggressiveness of cuts being priced in the forward curve is primarily a response to growth risks because inflation swaps continue to make new highs.

We now have almost 100bps of cuts priced for 2025:

This pricing of rates and negative price action in equities is in a regime where ADP came out above expectations, and NFP is expected to accelerate tomorrow.

The combination of the tariff risk and the Fed’s stance on accelerating inflation expectations is WHY the stock bond correlation has turned negative.

The main principle to think about when you have this type of drawdown is: The larger the drawdown, the greater the macro change that needs to take place in order to set a bottom. This is why the equity strategy has been short; underlying macro drivers and positioning premiums continue to skew equities to the downside. We have see short term bounces here and there, but overall, the risks driving equities down and bonds up have not reversed.

I will expand on these further in the strategy section.

It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_

The index closed down **\-1.68%**, with weakness broad, persistent, and mechanical. **Info Tech (-0.70%)**, **Financials (-0.29%)**, and **Industrials (-0.26%)** were the heaviest drags, accounting for nearly **75% of the move**. Tech alone took out **~40%** of the day's loss clear signpost of high-beta exposure coming off.

No rotation into defensives. **Staples (+0.02%)**, **Healthcare (-0.07%)**, **Utilities (-0.03%)** all basically flat. There’s no shelter being sought — this is position unwinding across the board.

**This is not rotation, this is risk reduction.**

**Broad-based**, methodical selling, no single-sector unwind, no panic just consistent deleveraging.

The S&P 500 closed **\-1.68%**, but **under the hood, the damage was far worse**. What looked like a moderate index decline masked **full-blown cyclical carnage**:

*   **Energy -4.97%** → Brutal washout. Linked to oil weakness, but also reflects position de-risking amid rising recession odds.
    
*   **Industrials -3.13%**, **Materials -2.51%**, **Discretionary -2.13%** → All screaming slowdown. These are the sectors that catch macro air pockets first this is textbook growth scare behavior.
    
*   **Info Tech -2.39%**, **Financials -1.98%**, **Real Estate -2.26%** → The largest index contributors were uniformly smashed, confirming this is not a rotation but full de-grossing.
    

*   **Utilities -1.18%**, **Healthcare -0.60%**, **Comm Services -1.49%** → Even defensives were sold. This wasn't a growth-to-defensive pivot **this was a cash bid.**
    
*   **Staples +0.38%** → The lone green sector. A weak bid for classic defensives, but too minor to offset the wave of selling elsewhere.

Today’s sector breadth shows a sharp deterioration in participation,this selloff was deep and wide, pointing to real de-risking rather than a sector-specific unwind.

The recent move higher in this credit measure is hard to ignore now pushing above 67, it's a clear break from the subdued levels that have persisted through most of late 2023 and early 2024. This jump signals rising stress in credit markets, consistent with a broader risk-off tone across assets. Notably, it's the sharpest move since early 2023, suggesting that liquidity is tightening, and investors are beginning to demand higher compensation for credit risk.

Combined with the tariff enduced broad equity sell off, the message is clear: macro risk is re-pricing and credit is starting to speak the same language as rates and equities.

Gold is fundamentally about macro liquidity which means the drivers are marginally different than ES and the 2-year.

In the top panel, the total impulse of macro drivers and positioning is illustrated in its strength. The greater the strength in the move, the higher the probability and amplitude of the move that is likely to take place. The bottom panel illustrates if the skew is either bullish or bearish probability.

We are seeing a marginal shift in the 2-year strategy with the skew turning bullish. This has overlapped with Bitcoin turning marginally bullish as well. As more and more cuts get priced into the forward as equities sell off, this creates an overlap in positioning where if the cuts aren’t realized then it will likely cause bonds to pull back and equities to rally.
