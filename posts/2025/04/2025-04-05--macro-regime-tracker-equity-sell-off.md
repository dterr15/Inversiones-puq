_**The Macro Regime Tracker offers a daily lens on how shifts in growth, inflation, and liquidity affect short-term risk and reward. Leveraging machine learning, AI, and cross-asset data, it identifies macro changes and their impact on market positioning.**_

We are in a consequential time in markets as the VIX closed at 45 today, and equities saw vicious selling pressure across every sector.

Managing these periods of time is THE differentiating factor for both active and passive investors. As we came into this week, the warning signs were clear and picked up by the equity model as it was skewing prices to the downside moving into today. Monitoring the macro and positioning drivers is THE KEY to knowing WHEN a potential bottom occurs or if we see further downside moving into markets on Monday. **As I have said multiple times, the larger the drawdown, the greater the macro drivers we see for a bottom and reversal to occur.** I will lay these out further in the strategy section.

> > _**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_

The S&P 500 fell sharply today, closing down **\-3.67%**, marking a significant acceleration in downside momentum compared to yesterday’s -1.68% decline. The catalyst: the formal implementation of **new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods**, quickly followed by **retaliatory measures out of Beijing**. Markets responded with a **broad-based and mechanical sell-off**, consistent with a **deleveraging regime**, not panic.

Losses were again widespread, but deeper and more evenly distributed across sectors. Key contributors included:

*   **Information Technology (-1.11%)**: Once again the heaviest drag, reflecting beta purge and growth exposure unwinding.
    
*   **Financials (-0.85%)** and **Healthcare (-0.55%)**: Together with Tech, these sectors drove the bulk of the move.
    
*   **Industrials (-0.34%)** and **Consumer Staples (-0.26%)**: Joined the downside pressure as trade-sensitive and defensive areas alike sold off.
    
*   Even **Utilities (-0.15%)**, **REITs (-0.09%)**, and **Staples (-0.26%)** offered no shelter.
    

This is **not a rotation**, it’s **a full-scale risk reduction** — the entire market is in unwind mode. The decline is **orderly but relentless**, suggesting systematic flows and stop-outs, not discretionary panic.

Yesterday's narrative, “no place to hide” has only intensified. **Every sector closed negative**, with no sign of crowding into defensives or yield proxies. The S&P 500's -3.67% fall underscores that this is no ordinary pullback; it's a broad **repricing of risk**, catalyzed by a real-world macro shock.

The S&P 500 ended the day down **\-3.67%**, but the **unweighted damage reveals a far more violent unwind** beneath the surface. This was **indiscriminate selling** not just broad, but **deep and vicious across classic cyclical sectors**.

*   **Energy (-7.05%)**: Absolute capitulation. This kind of move speaks to forced selling and liquidations not just falling crude.
    
*   **Financials (-5.90%)**, **Utilities (-5.61%)**, **Healthcare (-4.77%)**: Deep losses even in typically “defensive” pockets.
    
*   **Industrials (-4.03%)**, **Materials (-4.88%)**, **Staples (-4.02%)**: Textbook recession repricing. This is the market trying to get ahead of a growth shock.
    
*   **Discretionary (-0.85%)**: Surprisingly resilient, but the relative outperformance is likely a function of the breadth of the rest collapsing.
    

*   **Tech (-3.82%)**, **Financials (-5.90%)**, **Staples (-4.02%)**, **Health (-4.77%)** all down heavily on an unweighted basis, confirming that even megacaps weren’t spared. There’s **nowhere to hide**.
    

*   This isn’t a hedge, **it’s a race for cash**. Everything from high beta to low vol is getting dumped.
    
*   **No safe havens:** REITs (-3.86%) and even Utilities (-5.61%) were trashed, likely reflecting margin-related selling.
    

The unweighted internals **speak louder than the headline index**: this is **classic macro de-risking**, likely fueled by both fundamental concerns (tariffs, growth, margins) and mechanical drivers (stop-outs, deleveraging).

The final session’s price action wasn’t just ugly, it **ripped apart the underlying structure** of the S&P 500. The charts of **10-day, 20-day, and 50-day moving average sector contributions** all show the same story: a **complete smash** in breadth.

Credit is now **clearly catching up to equities and rates** in pricing macro stress. The index just surged to **72.20**, the highest since mid-2023, decisively breaking above both its **multi-month range** and its **long-term average** (~62.9). This isn't a wobble, it's a **material repricing of credit risk**.

There’s no single corporate story to point to here, this is **macro stress transmitting across all asset classes**. Rates, equities, and now credit are all saying the same thing: the market is re-assessing the global growth and policy outlook in real-time.

The last few months lulled many into thinking credit would remain well-behaved amid rising equity volatility. That illusion is gone. Credit is **now fully participating in the risk-off move**, and its recent velocity adds a **potential accelerant** to any further equity downside.

The STIR complex just delivered a **powerful message**: the market now sees **over 100bps of rate cuts by the end of 2025**, with **133bps priced through July 2026**. That’s a **40bps dovish shift in just a few days**, driven by a collapse in equities, widening credit spreads, and rising fears of a policy mistake.

But **the Fed isn’t blinking.** Chair Powell’s latest remarks paint a central bank that is **very aware of rising downside risks, but in no rush to act.**

Despite the market’s clear shift in expectations, Powell signaled:

*   _“We’re not in a situation like the 1970s.”_
    
*   _“The Fed is waiting for clarity about what our policy should be.”_
    
*   _“Outside forecasters have raised the likelihood of a recession.”_
    

Yet in the same breath, he emphasized:

*   _“Incoming data still shows a solid economy.”_
    
*   _“Unemployment is still low.”_
    
*   _“The economy is close to maximum employment and still growing.”_
    

The **subtext is clear**: the Fed sees the market moving but won’t react **just because asset prices are under pressure**. It’s comfortable letting **financial conditions tighten via market mechanisms** while it waits for the data to break.

In this context, we ran a short-term trade in the tactical portfolio (these are laid out in the chart section: [LINK](https://open.substack.com/chat/posts/405a1d2c-561e-4b5b-90ec-1a9a475b1831)). What we saw was such an aggressive and forced unwind that Fed Funds for April actually priced hikes that were likely unrealistic given the underlying economic fundamentals.

As of market close, the strategies have updated, and here are the new directional skews. I want to walk you through the logic for WHY these are this way so you can understand HOW to think about markets on Monday.

_**(The Growth Risk Premium Driver contribution identifies HOW the drivers of growth are contributing to equity returns. In the same manner, the higher the contribution moves, the more strength the drivers have in pushing the index in a specific direction.)**_

On net, the ES model has flipped marginally positive for a bullish directional skew. However, the strength of the underlying factors still has risks. In other words, being cautious into Monday is important, but betting on an immediate downside has a lower risk reward.

This marginal shift in ES has overlapped with the downside in the 2 year, beginning to decrease. I laid out the trade write up ([link](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/trade-write-ups-bonds-and-credit)) explaining how significant upside existed in both the 2026 SOFR contracts to price more cuts AND upside in ZN. These have been realized and especially in light of Powell’s comments today, taking additional aggressive bets on the long side in bonds is beginning to be less attractive between now and FOMC.
