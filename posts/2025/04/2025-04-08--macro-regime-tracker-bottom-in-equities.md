China is the world's largest exporter, while the United States is the largest importer. On one side, China weaponizes its balance of payments and currency to actively undermine the global order. On the other hand, the United States holds the global reserve currency—the foundation of international trade and finance. When global trade is disrupted, it jeopardizes the surplus of dollar liquidity that many countries have long depended on.

This is honestly why the actions of Trump seem almost out of place due to their extremity because their implications are quite literally the entire world of trade and finance. The more I look at the situation, the more I think that Trump and Bessent are creating a massive narrative to misdirect market participants.

Remember, equities have sold off due to the uncertainty surrounding these dynamics. Notice that earnings expectations have remained largely unchanged, and the primary driver to the downside has been the valuation component. Valuations are primarily connected to macro liquidity, which makes a lot of sense in the context of the liquidity implications above. (Chart is of Mag7 earnings and valuations):

In my view, it seems highly unlikely that the US will take both its deficit and trade balance to zero. Even if the US cut off all imports from China, the goods and services will just get routed through another country. It is impossible for the US to actually move into an isolationist stance. This was one of the primary dynamics I drew attention to in the macro report:

So the million dollar question is, why in the world are Trump and Bessent taking this approach when realistically it's highly unlikely that they will be able to actually cut off ties with the system of international trade and finance?

What if the drama between Powell and Trump is all an orchestrated narrative to keep the media focused on drama instead of looking at what all three of them (Trump, Powell, and Bessent) are accomplishing together? Is it possible that they are working together to create some tariff uncertainty that causes credit markets to slow and thereby put downward pressure on growth? The result of this would be ensuring inflation is really dead and growth is at a lower LEVEL so that interest rates can come down and secure cheaper financing for the government.

I don’t know if this is the case, but there are so many glaring questions that you have to stop and think, why are they all telling us to look in the same direction? IF Trump were to walk back even 50% of the statements about tariffs, the S&P500 would trade 400-500 points higher, and Bitcoin would push back to the 100k level.

I will dig into this further after covering the strategies.

> _**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_

The S&P 500 staged a powerful rally today, finishing up +3.31% and erasing a substantial portion of its recent losses. After days of escalating tariff headlines and systematic deleveraging, the market pivoted dramatically as whispers of potential negotiations (or at least a pause in hostilities) appeared to spark heavy short-covering and renewed risk appetite.

Unlike the previous “no place to hide” rout, today’s price action was a broad-based surge higher. Almost every sector contributed positively, led by:

*   **Information Technology (+1.34%)** – Tech roared back, fueling the lion’s share of the index return. This looks like a beta-led rebound, with investors once again allocating to growth-oriented names.
    
*   **Communication Services (+0.39%)** and **Consumer Discretionary (+0.38%)** – These cyclical, consumer-driven segments jumped as sentiment improved. Investors appear willing to look past near-term uncertainty for higher-return exposures.
    
*   **Financials (+0.29%)** – A major turnaround from yesterday’s selling. The sector benefited from improved credit-market sentiment and the possibility of a steadier macro outlook.
    
*   **Health Care (+0.20%)** and **Industrials (+0.18%)** – Moderate gains suggest a broad-based shift back into both defensives (Health Care) and economically sensitive sectors (Industrials).
    
*   **Energy (+0.11%)** – Up modestly, as improved risk sentiment lifted oil prices and energy equities together.
    
*   **Utilities (+0.02%)** and **Materials (+0.02%)** – Both saw small positive prints, reflecting that risk-on flows favored higher-beta names, but these segments still eked out gains.
    
*   **Real Estate (-0.02%)** – The lone laggard, essentially flat. Rising rates or rotation away from yield proxies may have kept a lid on REITs.
    

This turnaround underscores how sensitive markets remain to trade-related headlines. After several sessions of mechanical and relentless selling that felt very much like a systematic unwind, today’s action had the hallmarks of short-covering and opportunistic dip buying. Importantly, we did not see the “panic” behavior that often characterizes major turning points; rather, the market methodically bid up virtually everything except Real Estate.

The S&P 500 finished the day up +3.31%, but the unweighted internals reveal an even more dramatic rebound beneath the surface. After days of mechanical, across-the-board selling, today’s action looked like a classic short-covering surge with investors piling back into risk.

*   **Information Technology (+4.58%)** – Tech led the charge, suggesting a sudden re-risking in growth-oriented names that were heavily sold off in the recent unwind. This is textbook “beta grab” as traders scramble to regain exposure.
    
*   **Communication Services (+4.18%)** and **Consumer Discretionary (+3.67%)** – Surging on the back of improved sentiment, these consumer-driven, higher-beta sectors also benefited from renewed optimism.
    
*   **Energy (+3.09%)** – A sharp snapback, indicative of forced covering more than any fundamental shift in oil or gas markets.
    
*   **Industrials (+2.19%)** and **Financials (+1.98%)** – Deeply cyclical corners of the market reawakened, in line with the broader risk-on pivot.
    
*   **Health Care (+1.75%)** and **Consumer Staples (+1.42%)** – Defensive sectors participated solidly in the rebound, reinforcing that the move was broad, not merely sector-specific.
    
*   **Utilities (+0.70%)** and **Materials (+0.82%)** – Both modestly higher, confirming the marketwide lift.
    
*   **Real Estate (-0.88%)** – The only sector in the red. This may reflect ongoing sensitivity to rates or a rotation away from yield proxies, which suffered during the volatility spike.
    

*   **Unweighted Metrics Outperform** – This was not a case of a few megacaps dragging the index higher; the rebound spanned nearly every sector.
    
*   **No Place to Hide (From Buying)** – The flip side of the prior session’s indiscriminate selling is today’s equally sweeping risk-on move, suggesting systematic flows reversed.
    
*   **Orderly Yet Relentless** – Much like the prior unwind, this rally appeared mechanical, pointing to forced short-covering and fast money flows rather than a fundamental shift in the macro picture.
    

This powerful +3.31% surge underscores how quickly market dynamics can flip when the threat of deeper tariff escalation takes a back seat—however briefly. The unweighted data highlights that nearly every pocket of the market participated, indicating this rally is more than just a large-cap relief bounce. From a macro perspective, volatility remains high; any renewed trade antagonism or macro shock could reignite selling.

Even though today's price action delivered a notable bounce, the underlying breadth tells a different story. The majority of stocks remain well below key technical levels, meaning that despite the short-term rally, the market remains extremely weak. This disparity suggests that today's bounce may be more of a temporary rebound rather than a broad-based recovery, as the widespread underlying weakness indicates that risk remains pervasive across the board.

Credit markets are sending an unmistakable warning sign. After breaking decisively above the key 62.9 threshold yesterday, credit risk just surged higher to 75.28, marking new multi-year high. This renewed spike underscores that the repricing isn’t idiosyncratic to a handful of issuers; it’s a broad-based, systemic move mirroring the heightened risk signals in equities and rates.

The velocity of this latest jump shatters any lingering notion that credit might remain insulated. Instead, it confirms that credit is now fully aligned with the broader risk-off narrative, amplifying the potential for negative feedback loops.

After a brief spell of panic drove implied cuts as high as 29bps for the May FOMC meeting (and nearly 35bps in June), calmer heads have prevailed, pulling those expectations back to 11bps and 23bps, respectively. Even so, roughly 96bps of total easing is now priced in through year-end, still a significant dovish swing in a short time.

From a trading perspective, we’re looking to fade these extremes in the very front end. Levels above 95.82 in the May Fed Funds contract and 96.12 in July offer a more attractive risk/reward setup for those expecting the market’s worst-case scenario to ease off. The key theme remains that the Fed won’t step in just to cushion an equity-market correction: it would likely take clear signs of credit stress or a genuine liquidity event to force a pivot, especially with inflation still elevated. Consequently, we remain comfortable fading the most aggressive rate-cut bets under current conditions.

The strength for the bullish ES trigger is increasing marginally as the charts above show. This is overlapping with the 2 year rate beginning to skew to the upside as well.

In my view, the downside for ES is decreasing significantly on a short-term basis. There has been such a significant amount of uncertainty priced based on the tariff news and especially the most recent China news that’s unrealistic. The price action today illustrates these drivers with the gap down and then retracement to being green on the day. Even when the White House called the tariff rumors “fake news”, ES held its strength and rallied into the close.

The same is true with ZN. ZN actually sold off more than ZT to cause the curve to steepen. This is not the type of price action you see during a recession.

It is clear that this administration is HORRIBLE at communicating but this just came across the tape and if its true, then Bessent is likely aware some credit deals are falling through and they need to be careful about causing an entire collapse through day after day gaps down in ES.

While we need to be careful, the developments in information and the models quantifying the macro drivers are beginning to skew ES to the upside and bonds to the downside on a short-term basis. We are most certainly not moving back into a “normal regime,” but the positioning signals and macro drivers are clear. The ranges are wider, so being nimble is still key.

As always, a Pepe for the culture:
