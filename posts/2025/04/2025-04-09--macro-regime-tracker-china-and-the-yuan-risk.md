We have seen some important developments with the tariffs on China today that caused equities to sell off. I laid this out in the intraday update:

As I have drawn attention to in yesterday’s note ([link](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/macro-regime-tracker-bottom-in-equities)), this action of 104% is so extreme that it almost seems like misdirection or a negotiating tactic. Intraday, the dollar made a significant rally against the Yuan as the news came out indicating the source of selling pressure in equities.

> > _**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_

The S&P 500 plunged **\-4.80%** today in a dramatic reversal of yesterday’s optimism, as renewed fears over the US-China trade war and looming reciprocal tariffs rattled risk assets across the board. Hopes of a de-escalation faded rapidly as confirmation came that **104% tariffs** would be imposed on a wide swath of Chinese imports. What followed was a brutal, **cross-asset unwind** driven by global growth fears, risk-aversion, and a re-rating of equity risk premia.

Unlike yesterday’s broad-based rebound, today’s **selloff was led decisively by the Information Technology sector**, which contributed the most to the downside:

*   **Information Technology (-1.70%)** – The epicenter of the selloff. Heavily-weighted tech names saw aggressive selling as traders rotated away from growth. A classic example of _high-beta fragility_ during macro uncertainty.
    
*   **Consumer Discretionary (-0.62%)** – Tariff exposure and cyclical sensitivity made this sector particularly vulnerable, reflecting worries about demand destruction and weakened consumer confidence.
    
*   **Financials (-0.48%)** – The yield curve steepened, but credit risk and equity weakness overwhelmed any rate benefit. Concerns about recession and funding pressures weighed on the group.
    
*   **Communication Services (-0.43%)** – Another growth-heavy sector hit hard amid widespread deleveraging.
    
*   **Health Care (-0.36%)** and **Industrials (-0.31%)** – Broad economic sensitivity drove these sectors lower, though losses were modest relative to tech.
    
*   **Energy (-0.15%)** – Oil’s 10% drop since Friday and weakness in product markets dragged the sector lower, despite geopolitical supply headlines.
    
*   **Consumer Staples (-0.17%)**, **Real Estate (-0.10%)**, **Utilities (-0.06%)**, and **Materials (-0.09%)** – Defensive segments didn’t offer refuge, although losses were more muted. The “no place to hide” dynamic was back in force.
    

*   The **short-covering rally has been unwound**, and positioning is again tilting defensive.
    
*   This time, **risk-off flows are more fundamental than mechanical** driven by recession fears, rising cross-asset correlations, and a breakdown in diversification (stocks and bonds both weaker).
    
*   **Volatility has returned to historic levels**, with four straight sessions of 5%+ trading ranges, a sign of systemic stress, not just noise.
    
*   Credit markets and inflation expectations are sending mixed signals to the Fed, leaving rate cut bets in place, but with growing questions about the efficacy of monetary policy in a trade-driven downturn.

The S&P 500 fell sharply by **\-4.80%**, but the **unweighted sector breakdown** paints an even starker picture: **virtually no area of the market was spared**, with steep losses across every sector, from high-beta growth to defensive yield plays.

What began as an orderly repricing turned into a **system-wide liquidation**, as confirmation of **104% tariffs on Chinese goods** and collapsing confidence in global growth triggered a wave of systematic selling.

*   **Consumer Discretionary (-5.97%)** – The hardest-hit group, reflecting fears of demand destruction and exposure to import-sensitive goods.
    
*   **Information Technology (-5.87%)** – High-beta growth names unwound sharply, reversing the prior day’s surge amid fears of slowing investment and trade friction.
    
*   **Materials (-4.74%)** – A proxy for global industrial activity, deeply affected by the tariff escalation.
    
*   **Energy (-4.57%)** – Continued collapse in oil demand expectations has now spilled over to the broader energy complex.
    
*   **Communication Services (-4.50%)** – Weakness in ad-based, discretionary, and media businesses was pronounced.
    
*   **Real Estate (-4.26%)** – Yield-sensitive REITs sold off alongside rising volatility and funding market stress.
    
*   **Industrials (-3.70%)** – Cyclical names dragged lower by the threat of global recession and weakened export channels.
    
*   **Financials (-3.26%)** – Despite curve steepening, macro stress and credit concerns weighed heavily.
    
*   **Health Care (-3.18%)** – Defensive in theory, but caught in broad-based deleveraging flows.
    
*   **Consumer Staples (-2.73%)** and **Utilities (-2.34%)** – Even classic defensives were dumped, showing how widespread the liquidation became.
    

*   Yesterday’s short-covering rally gave way to a complete reversal as **macro risks reasserted themselves**.
    
*   The breadth of the selloff was _total_: the unweighted index dropped **in near lockstep with the cap-weighted**, confirming that **this was no longer just about the mega caps**.
    
*   This sort of **“no place to hide” action** is more typical of risk events tied to policy missteps or macro shocks, and today delivered both.
    

*   **The rally was a trap**, yesterday’s beta grab has been unwound and then some.
    
*   **Volatility is sticky**: four straight days of >5% intraday ranges underscore the mechanical nature of current flows, this is _not_ valuation-driven selling.
    
*   The **tariff shock is acting as a tax on global growth**, with ripple effects from equities to bonds, currencies, and commodities.
    
*   **Even defensive plays are failing**, signaling that deleveraging is in charge now.

Across all three timeframes **10D**, **20D**, and **50D** moving averages, today marks a **notable contraction in breadth**, confirming the **indiscriminate nature of the latest selloff**.

Credit markets are **decisively widening**, with high-yield spreads breaking sharply higher to **81.05 bps**, a level not seen since the regional bank stress in early 2023. The chart shows a **clear breakout** from the post-2023 compression range, and that breakout is gathering pace.

This move **mirrors the equity volatility**, the surge in cross-asset correlations, and recent _panic signals_ in risk assets. Importantly, it’s happening in tandem with:

*   A **yield curve steepening**, but for the _wrong reasons_, reflecting funding concerns, not reflation.
    
*   A **collapse in equity market breadth** and growing evidence of _deleveraging_.
    
*   **Liquidity stress** building under the surface, with swap spreads in long-end SOFR nearing extreme levels.

Markets have moved aggressively to **price in front-loaded rate cuts**, with **110.5 bps** of total easing expected by year-end 2025 — and **nearly half of that (45.7 bps)** concentrated in just the **next two FOMC meetings**.

*   **May 7**: 78% chance of a 25 bp cut fully priced.
    
*   **June 18**: 104% of a 25 bp cut priced; i.e. **a full cut plus a decent shot at a second.**
    
*   **By July 30**: ~70 bps of easing expected, **nearly three full cuts in just three meetings.**
    

*   **Market sees policy urgency**: The **front-loading** of cuts suggests investors are positioning for **rapid deterioration in growth or financial conditions**, rather than a smooth, data-driven easing path.
    
*   Pricing is consistent with escalating **credit stress**, **tariff-driven stagflation**, and rising **cross-asset volatility**.
    
*   Beyond July, the curve **flattens**, suggesting uncertainty or conditionality around how deep the easing cycle can go.
    

*   The **first cut is now “when,” not “if.”** Any pause or hawkish lean in Fed communication (especially CPI) could provoke a sharp short-end re-steepening.
    
*   The **next 3 meetings (April–July)** are critical with **69.5 bps priced**, this is where **expectations are most vulnerable** to being re-priced, either by sticky inflation or resilient labor markets.
    
*   If risk-off persists and **equities, credit, and energy remain under pressure**, the front-end could invert further as **cut urgency intensifies**.

As of market close, the strategies have updated, and here are the new directional skews.

We are still seeing the ES strategy skew price to the upside. I will be weighing this against how much change take place through the Asia session due to the tariff risk.
