Today, it was shown that trading from headline to headline and tariff risk remain real. With such a large rally yesterday, it isn’t surprising to see a marginal retracement today. The end-of-week flows and trading into tomorrow will be critical for directionality into FOMC.

_**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_

The S&P 500 sank -1.45% in a broad-based selloff as investor optimism over a temporary tariff pause quickly faded. Market participants refocused on the growing economic risks tied to Trump’s chaotic trade war escalation, particularly the record 145% tariff rate on Chinese goods. Safe-haven demand surged, growth expectations dimmed, and recession fears resurfaced.

**Information Technology (-0.35%)** – Tech led the decline, as mega-cap names saw heavy de-risking. The sector remains acutely sensitive to global growth fears and earnings opacity driven by the unpredictable tariff regime.

**Communication Services (-0.31%)** – A sharp pullback in growth-heavy names that had led Wednesday’s rally. Reversal trades dominated, with many high-beta names facing renewed pressure.

**Health Care (-0.21%)** – Defensive characteristics offered little shelter as the sector was pulled down alongside broader equity weakness. Uncertainty in corporate guidance added to the drag.

**Financials (-0.20%)** – Rising long-end yields failed to lift the sector as macro risks eclipsed any curve steepening benefit. Banks remain vulnerable to risk-off positioning.

**Consumer Discretionary (-0.17%)** – The sector gave back part of Wednesday’s gains, as doubts re-emerged about the impact of higher consumer prices and trade disruption on household spending.

**Energy (-0.14%)** – Oil prices slipped again amid global demand concerns, leaving the sector under pressure. Sentiment remains tightly linked to macro expectations.

**Industrials (-0.07%)** – Trade war exposure continues to weigh heavily. The sector remains a barometer for global trade sentiment, and Thursday's price action pointed toward skepticism over resolution.

**Materials (-0.04%)**, **Real Estate (-0.02%)**, **Consumer Staples (-0.01%)** – These sectors posted modest losses, offering minimal insulation from broad de-risking. Defensive postures held relatively better, but investors avoided committing capital amid macro fog.

**Utilities (0.00%)** – The lone neutral sector on the day. A slight bid in rate-sensitive names was offset by the broader market drag.

Thursday’s pullback marked a sharp reality check for markets that had briefly embraced the idea of tariff relief. Instead, investors were reminded of the erratic and opaque policy regime, which continues to destabilize both corporate planning and asset pricing.

Risk appetite deteriorated as:

*   **Forward guidance** from companies collapsed into silence.
    
*   **Volatility surged**, with the VIX spiking back above 40.
    
*   **Yields climbed**, suggesting that fears of inflation and funding stress are coexisting uncomfortably with recession risk.
    
*   **Systematic flows reversed**, and selling accelerated across growth and cyclicals.
    

The post-pause rally is now clearly revealed as a technical unwind, not a fundamental shift in outlook. With China still under aggressive tariffs and no diplomatic off-ramp in sight, recession probabilities are rising, not falling. Expect continued volatility, poor visibility on earnings, and fading confidence in policy direction.

**Energy (-4.33%)** – The worst-performing sector. Oil demand fears reemerged forcefully as recession risks and trade uncertainty overshadowed yesterday’s bounce. E&Ps and service names reversed gains aggressively.

**Communication Services (-3.25%)** – Growth darlings were dumped. Heavily shorted names saw yesterday’s relief squeezed out in a sharp reversal, underscoring fragile positioning and deep skepticism about forward guidance.

**Health Care (-1.91%)** – Despite its defensive nature, the sector broke lower amid concerns over margin compression and a lack of visibility into post-tariff consumer behavior.

**Materials (-1.79%)** – A major reversal in cyclical sentiment. While these names bounced yesterday, today's action shows lingering structural concern about global trade volumes and input cost volatility.

**Consumer Discretionary (-1.58%)** – Retail and travel stocks fell back as consumer exposure to inflation and trade pass-through effects returned to focus. The policy backdrop remains too chaotic for sustained re-risking here.

**Financials (-1.41%)** – Yield curve stabilization failed to support the sector. Macro fears continue to outweigh rate moves, and investors remain wary of credit and liquidity risks in a volatile tape.

**Information Technology (-1.19%)** – Tech leadership crumbled with mega-caps dragging on the unweighted average. Semis and high-multiple names were under particular pressure.

**Real Estate (-0.93%)**, **Industrials (-0.86%)** – Both sectors suffered broad-based weakness. Industrial names retraced gains as optimism on trade thaw gave way to fresh supply chain anxiety, while REITs struggled with rising rate volatility.

**Consumer Staples (-0.11%)** – The most resilient of the day’s losers. Modest downside here reflects the defensive nature of the sector, but even staples are no longer immune to tariff-induced margin risk.

**Utilities (+0.16%)** – The lone green shoot. Lower beta, rate-sensitive, and viewed as a temporary shelter, Utilities caught some inflows amid broad de-risking.

Today’s unweighted sector performance paints a far bleaker picture than the headline index. Beneath the surface, breadth has eroded substantially, and participation in yesterday’s rally now looks more like a mechanical squeeze than a foundation for recovery.

*   **High-beta sectors reversed**, with Energy, Comm Services, and Discretionary all sharply lower.
    
*   **Defensives held better**, but failed to attract material upside flow — suggesting hesitation, not conviction.
    
*   **Breadth deterioration** adds to concerns that the market is still processing a shock, not stabilizing from it.
    

*   Markets remain deeply reactive, not proactive. This is a tape dominated by headline risk, shifting policy stances, and positioning whiplash.
    
*   The unweighted view underscores the fragility of sentiment: yesterday’s euphoria was thin, and today’s selling was broad-based and intense.
    
*   Until there is a credible policy pivot or macro stabilization, rallies should be treated as tactical and not the start of a durable recovery.
    
*   Volatility is the new norm, and average stock performance today sends a clear message: the underlying storm is far from over.

Today’s market action marks a stark reversal from yesterday’s surge, with the far-right edge of all three charts (10-day, 20-day, and 50-day moving averages) showing a clear collapse in sector participation.

Unlike yesterday’s surge, which showed synchronized strength across nearly every sector, today’s pullback reflects a decisive rejection of risk, a clear reversion from risk-on to risk-off positioning.

Credit markets took a sharp turn for the worse today, with high-yield spreads spiking to **74.80 bps**, breaching both the long-term average of **62.91 bps** and the post-COVID median. This marks a clear deterioration in credit sentiment, coinciding with heightened equity volatility, collapsing breadth, and growing macro uncertainty tied to the ongoing tariff escalation.

Today’s surge breaks the tentative stabilization seen in yesterday’s session and confirms that credit is no longer just reacting to equities — it’s now leading the stress signal. This is often a critical turning point in market structure, where credit deterioration feeds back into equity fragility.

**We are watching**

*   A **further breakdown in earnings guidance**, especially from cyclicals and highly levered firms
    
*   Deterioration in **primary issuance demand** as volatility sidelines buyers
    
*   **Spillover into investment-grade** and funding markets if spreads continue to widen
    
*   Renewed **policy uncertainty** around fiscal or trade that accelerates the de-risking

Rate futures resumed pricing a more aggressive easing path, with **90.7 bps of cuts now expected by year-end 2025**, up sharply from yesterday. Traders have shifted decisively toward a renewed Fed cutting cycle, driven by market turmoil, deepening credit stress, and the absence of a coherent policy resolution.

**Key Pricing Shifts**

*   **Two full cuts priced across the next three meetings**:
    
    *   **June 18**: 18.8 bps priced (75.2% chance of a cut)
        
    *   **July 30**: 20.9 bps priced (83.6% chance) → Market sees **back-to-back cuts as baseline**, reflecting concern over deteriorating conditions.
        
*   **May 7**: 9.5 bps priced (38.0% probability) – modest but rising chance of an earlier start to easing.
    
*   **By September 2025**: 66.4 bps priced across four meetings – a material shift from the post-rally unwind.
    
*   **Full year 2025**: 90.7 bps of easing priced – **retracing more than half** of yesterday’s retracement and reflecting growing conviction that rate cuts are coming, and soon.
    

**Crisis risk re-priced back in**: Yesterday’s pause in front-end easing was short-lived. The renewed volatility across equities, credit, and sector breadth has pulled forward expectations for policy response especially if incoming data reinforces softening demand or sticky uncertainty.

**June/July now the focus**: The market sees **June 18 and July 30 as consecutive cut meetings**, a clear reflection of deteriorating confidence in the Fed’s ability to wait-and-see. This marks a return to pre-pause urgency in the rate path.

**CPI reinforces the shift**: This morning’s **softer-than-expected inflation data** gave markets further confidence that the Fed has cover to begin easing:

*   **Headline CPI MoM** printed at **\-0.1%** vs. +0.1% est.
    
*   **Core CPI MoM** at **+0.1%** vs. +0.3% est.
    
*   **YoY measures** also cooled, with **Core CPI YoY at +2.8%** vs. 3.0% est.
    

These results suggest underlying disinflation is broadening particularly in core goods and some services, just as financial conditions are tightening amid trade policy shocks. This dual dynamic strengthens the case for a **more front-loaded Fed pivot**.

**Conditional easing, but urgency rising**: Traders still see 2025 cuts as data-driven, but the sharp rise in risk premiums and now-confirmed disinflation trends have reintroduced a near-term bias to act. The market is no longer pricing “panic,” but it is clearly bracing for trouble, and now believes the Fed can cut without stoking inflation fears.
