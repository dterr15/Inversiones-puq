_**The Macro Regime Tracker offers a daily lens on how shifts in growth, inflation, and liquidity affect short-term risk and reward. Leveraging machine learning, AI, and cross-asset data, it identifies macro changes and their impact on market positioning.**_

**The farther we progress into the new macro regime, the more I believe that the following are becoming increasingly important to understand:**

1.  The tariffs are likely to cause underlying rotation and redistribution across the global economy. I don’t believe an explicit recession or inflation upturn is the base case. The stance of monetary policy and intentionality by the political administration indicate that they are here to accomplish their goals on a geopolitical front but underlying deleveraging isn’t taking place.
    

The Bank of America Earnings release today illustrates this tension:

> **Summary:**  
> Bank of America reported stronger-than-expected Q1 2025 earnings, with net income rising to $7.4 billion, or $0.90 per share, exceeding forecasts. Solid performance in trading and higher net interest income drove the beat, despite weakness in investment banking. Management maintained its NII guidance and continues to streamline operations amid a cautious economic backdrop.

**Key Developments:**

*   Trading revenue jumped 9% YoY, with record equity trading and strong fixed income performance.
    
*   Net interest income rose 3% to $14.4B, with full-year guidance reaffirmed.
    
*   Investment banking fees fell 3% due to slower M&A and IPO activity.
    
*   Credit loss provisions increased to $1.5B, reflecting ongoing credit risk vigilance.
    
*   Workforce reductions continued, bringing total headcount down slightly to 212,732.
    

2.  AI is likely beginning the transition of Mag7 tech names into more of a utility-like stance as opposed to them being disruptive in nature. When companies like Apple (the largest weighting in the index) show a continual absence of innovation, they become complacent with the moat that they possess.
    

3.  The supply chain and value chain face uncertainty and constraints due to the tariffs. When deciding whether to invest in domestic capital expenditures (CapEx) to avoid tariffs or absorb the tariffs as ongoing costs, companies face a high-stakes trade-off between long-term strategic positioning and short-term flexibility. Onshoring requires significant upfront investment, which may become a sunk cost if tariffs are later removed, effectively making the decision a costly hedge against policy volatility. Conversely, choosing to pay the tariffs preserves optionality but risks being structurally uncompetitive if rivals onshore and lower their long-term unit costs. The uncertainty around geopolitical tensions and trade policy cycles compounds this dilemma, as firms must weigh durability of tariffs against the speed of potential reversals. Inaction or indecision can be just as risky, as market leaders who commit early may secure supply chain resilience and pricing power before others react.
    

4.  Finally, the tariffs are creating greater focus and concentration on base rare earth metals. Companies like [MP 0.00%↑](https://substack.com/discover/stocks/MP) illustrate this in their outperformance against Mag7 (blue).

_**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_
