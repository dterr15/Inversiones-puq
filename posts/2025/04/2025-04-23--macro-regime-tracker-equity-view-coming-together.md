The ES view that I laid out yesterday has been confirmed in the rally today, and gap up after futures open. Part of this dynamic is that on a short-term time horizon, ES was positioned so bearish due to the tariff risk that a marginal change in the news would cause a rally. Positioning is always oscillating between the constraints of the macro regime, so I am going to be breaking these dynamics down extensively in today’s report.

When you have a headline like this during the hour that futures are closed, it isn’t surprising to see a gap, but we need to properly connect this to macro flows:

_**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_
