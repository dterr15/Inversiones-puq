This was a very helpful chart I came across for the supply chain across various countries on solar. Part of the difficulty in predicting things is the inherent interdependencies of everything. The free market will always find a way for capital to flow to the most efficient place and these supply chain interdependencies create the conduit through which capital will be flowing.

_**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_
