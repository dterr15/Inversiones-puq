When I launched Capital Flows, the goal was simple but ambitious: break down the **full spectrum of macro flows** and convert them into high-conviction trades across rates, FX, and risk assets.

We now have the following sections of the Capital Flows Substack:

*   **[Macro Regime Tracker](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/s/macro-regime-tracker-daily-systematic)** – A daily machine-learning dashboard that converts the latest growth, inflation, and liquidity data into real-time regime probabilities across all major assets.
    
*   **[Macro Reports](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/s/macro-reports)** – Monthly deep-dives that explain each regime shift and connect quantified economic trends to interest-rate, FX, equity, and commodity markets.
    
*   **[Alpha Reports](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/s/alpha-reports)** – Bi-weekly analyses that rank assets by risk-reward, volatility-adjusted carry, and correlation structure to surface the most asymmetric opportunities.
    
*   **[Trade Reports](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/s/trades)** – Synthesize the full research stack into specific opportunities with the highest risk-reward profile, detailing the thesis, catalysts, and practical execution paths.

**That foundation now allows us to think bigger.**

The 2025–26 roadmap focuses on three pillars:

1.  **AI/ML‑Driven Macro Matrix** – machine‑learning models ingest daily market data and global information flows across every asset class, generating real‑time regime probabilities.
    
2.  **Trade Matrix Dashboard** – an interactive map linking each asset to its growth‑ and inflation‑beta, surfacing long/short pairs with the sharpest asymmetry under current conditions.
    
3.  **Geopolitical Risk Intelligence Briefs** – curated dispatches that translate shifting geopolitics into quantified economy‑wide and market‑specific risk‑flow scenarios.
    

The convergence of AI, Machine Learning, Social Media, and Markets have created an environment where unprecedented things will take place. The Capital Flows Substack will be part of that future.

As we enter the second half of 2025, the quality and scope of Capital Flows will expand to a comprehensive suite of AI/Machine‑Learning Macro Models. As we move into the second half of the year, there will be price increases to fuel future growth and innovation on the Substack. **I’m offering a one‑time discount so that early adopters who share an unconventional worldview can lock in the current rate and capture all of the future upside. This is the final opportunity to lock in the current Capital Flows Substack rate. As new models and products are launched, the price will rise to over $200/month by the end of 2025.**

_**In the information age, you simply need to be at the right place, at the right time, with the right information to succeed**_

_**“You wasted $150,000 on an education you coulda got for $1.50 in late fees at the public library.”**_
