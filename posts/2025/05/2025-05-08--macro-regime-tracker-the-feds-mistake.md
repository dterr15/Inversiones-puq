_**The Macro Regime Tracker offers a daily lens on how shifts in growth, inflation, and liquidity affect short-term risk and reward. Leveraging machine learning, AI, and cross-asset data, it identifies macro changes and their impact on market positioning.**_

I want to make an important contextual point for the macro regime: long-end rates are compressing in a range on a cyclical basis as the Fed has paused YTD. This is setting the stage for the next move in interest rates which will force the Fed to change its stance.

The chart below shows that volatility has been compressing as the 10 year has been in a range since 2023:

2-year volatility has been marginally different as bearish drift has taken place during the Fed’s cutting cycle.

The problem with this is that since the beginning of 2025, the curve has been bear flattening, steepener twisting or bear steepening. The bull steepening was only momentary for the sell off in equities.

Why does this matter? Because the long end of the curve is screaming higher nominal GDP, and inflation is still above 2%. I know that core CPI has decelerated to 2.8% but all of us know that the data has been pretty biased in light of the tariff risk because corporations are buying and selling preemptively. This is why the 10 year is higher even as CPI is moving down.

Now we are unwinding the recession positioning completely as the Z5 contract approaches 50bps this year.

As I have laid out, the entire recession narrative is highly unrealistic based on the actual data.
