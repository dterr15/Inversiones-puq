See the context I laid out here for WHERE we are in the macro regime (I will be updating this with a report tomorrow for):

**Main Developments In Macro**

\*BARR: EXPECT TARIFFS TO LEAD TO HIGHER INFLATION, LOWER GROWTH

\*BARR: TARIFFS COULD CREATE PERSISTENT UPWARD PRESSURE ON INFL.

\*TRUMP: CHINA SHOULD OPEN UP ITS MARKET TO USA

\*TRUMP: 80% TARIFF ON CHINA SEEMS RIGHT

\*TRUMP: GOP SHOULD NOT INCREASE TAXES ON RICH, BUT OK IF THEY DO

_**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_
