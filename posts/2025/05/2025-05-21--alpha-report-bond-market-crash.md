I started a previous Alpha Report explaining that macro volatility is beginning, and no one is aware of it: [LINK](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/alpha-report-the-credit-cycle-bond)

I would strongly encourage you to review the entire report and playbook I wrote here explaining WHERE we are going with interest rates. You will need to understand this report and the connected trade write ups linked in the report to understand this report.

One of the primary write-ups I published for paid subscribers specifically focused on this and noted the specific risk reward in bonds ([link](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/trade-write-ups-the-next-leverage)):

We are now entering a period where risk increased after today’s price action. I am going to break down these risks and the respective flows in this report.
