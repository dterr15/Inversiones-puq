We are clearly entering a period of higher volatility in interest rates, and it continues to be expressed as we move through market sessions. Yesterday, we saw bonds sell off considerably as the curve continues to bear steepen. This shows that all of the narratives about an imminent recession are clearly wrong. I laid out the main ideas for this in yesterday’s report.

Attached below is the interest rate report breaking down WHERE we are in the macro regime and HOW it informs the volatility and risks of interest rates. I will be expanding on this with a report on real estate to further explain how the changes in interest rates will impact residential and commercial real estate.
