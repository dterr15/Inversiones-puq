The research, tensions, and redundancy planning for interest rates have been laid out in the following reports:

*   [Alpha Report: The Credit Cycle, Bond Market Crash, and Final Capitulation](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/alpha-report-the-credit-cycle-bond)
    
*   **[Alpha Report: BOND MARKET CRASH](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/alpha-report-bond-market-crash)**
    
*   **[Interest Rate Report: The risks are mounting](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/interest-rate-report-the-risks-are)**
    

We are in a period of the cycle where the Fed has already cut rates from their highs, and the 2-year is BELOW the long end. We are approaching a critical point because the long end is moving UP as inflation data compresses in a range. Notice that the 30-year has moved up and widened its spread from the short end to reflect higher nominal GDP expectations.

I want to zoom in specifically to the price action we saw this last week and how it relates to the short end.
