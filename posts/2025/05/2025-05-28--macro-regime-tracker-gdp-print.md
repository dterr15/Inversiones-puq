**Macro Overlay**

Market performance significantly improved following President Trump's decision to delay the 50% tariff on goods from the European Union until July 9. This development, coupled with a stronger-than-expected rebound in U.S. consumer confidence in May, contributed to broad market advancement. While Treasury yields eased, upcoming economic data and fiscal policy developments, including potential regulatory shifts and Federal Reserve commentary on inflation and tariff impacts, remain key economic factors. The easing of trade tensions provided immediate market relief, although underlying macroeconomic uncertainties persist.

**Bottom Line**

The S&P 500 advanced +0.83%, primarily driven by performance in Information Technology and Consumer Discretionary sectors. The delay in EU tariffs and an increase in consumer confidence were contributing factors. Utilities and Energy sectors exhibited relatively more subdued performance. Despite positive overnight developments, macroeconomic uncertainties and the potential for future tariff risks suggest ongoing market volatility.

**Current Spread: 55.7 bp (▼ ~3.8 bp d/d), marking a reversal of recent widening and indicating improved market sentiment. Spreads are now notably below the 5-year historical average (~63 bp), reflecting a more constructive credit environment.**

**Credit Context**

*   **< 60 bp:** Pre-tariff escalation range: supportive of duration-heavy buyers (LDI, insurers).
    
*   **60–70 bp:** Tariff and fiscal uncertainty zone: neutral-to-cautious stance warranted.
    
*   **\> 90 bp:** Severe stress breakout: still low probability.
    

**Macro Overlay**

Market sentiment improved following President Trump's decision to delay a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union until July 9, instead of June 1. This immediate de-escalation of trade tensions reduced a significant source of uncertainty. Further supporting the positive shift, U.S. consumer confidence showed a better-than-expected improvement in May, marking its first increase in six months. Treasury yields also eased during the trading session. While the immediate tariff threat has abated, fiscal uncertainty persists, and Federal Reserve commentary continues to highlight the potential for business uncertainty and inflation risks from trade dynamics.

**Bottom Line**

IG credit spreads have tightened to 55.7 bp, reflecting reduced immediate trade war concerns and improved macroeconomic data. Near-term volatility risks have decreased from recent highs, influenced by the tariff delay and positive consumer sentiment. Directional bias remains cautiously skewed toward stability or further tightening in the short term, provided no new significant negative catalysts emerge.
