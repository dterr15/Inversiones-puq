Energy lagged amid continued caution regarding global growth and mixed oil market signals. Market sentiment remains sensitive to evolving trade discussions, particularly US-China negotiations, as well as Federal Reserve guidance suggesting patience amid balanced economic risks.

Current Spread: 55.3 bp (▼ ~0.9 bp d/d), signaling modest tightening. Spreads remain notably below the 5-year historical average (~63.1 bp), indicating continued market stability tempered by cautious optimism.

*   **< 60 bp:** Stable, duration-friendly range supporting insurance and liability-driven investment (LDI) strategies.
    
*   **60–70 bp:** Neutral-to-cautious positioning recommended amid tariff uncertainties and macroeconomic volatility.
    
*   **\> 90 bp:** Significant market distress—currently unlikely without a major escalation in geopolitical or macroeconomic shocks.
    

Today's slight tightening in IG credit spreads to 55.3 bp reflects cautiously improved investor sentiment stemming from anticipated trade discussions between President Trump and President Xi Jinping. Positive market reaction to the potential easing of U.S.-China tariff tensions partially offset ongoing macroeconomic concerns, such as uncertainty surrounding inflation dynamics, soft consumer spending trends, and subdued import growth figures. Treasury yields edged higher amid stabilizing sentiment, yet the broader economic environment continues to prompt cautious positioning given unresolved trade issues and regulatory uncertainties.

Credit markets currently exhibit resilience, balancing cautious optimism around trade developments with heightened vigilance toward macroeconomic signals and potential policy shifts by the Federal Reserve.

Bottom Line

IG credit spreads tightened modestly to 55.3 bp, demonstrating a cautiously optimistic market tone buoyed by improved trade sentiment.
