Today we are launching the momentum and mean reversion models for the Capital Flows Substack. Quantifying price action using momentum and mean reversion is one of the single most helpful things I have done in markets because it connects macro views with price action. I have recorded a video, provided an educational primer, and all of the models for momentum and mean reversion. These will be published daily in the Macro Regime Tracker ([link](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/s/macro-regime-tracker-daily-systematic)) moving forward.

As always, a Pepe for the culture:
