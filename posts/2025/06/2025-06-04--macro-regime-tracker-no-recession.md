_**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_

*   **Industrials (+0.06 pp)** – Benefited from improving economic outlook and diminished near-term tariff concerns.
    
*   **Health Care (+0.06 pp)** – Modestly positive, buoyed by stable demand and investor appetite for defensive sectors.

**Current Spread:** 55.0 bp (▼ ~0.3 bp d/d), indicating continued modest tightening. Current spreads remain comfortably below the 5-year historical average (~62.9 bp), underscoring persistent stability despite macroeconomic uncertainties.

*   **< 60 bp:** Stable, duration-friendly range supporting insurance and liability-driven investment (LDI) strategies.
    
*   **60–70 bp:** Neutral-to-cautious positioning recommended amid tariff uncertainties and macroeconomic volatility.
    
*   **\> 90 bp:** Significant market distress—currently unlikely without a major escalation in geopolitical or macroeconomic shocks.
    

The marginal tightening in IG credit spreads to 54.96 bp today underscores investor sentiment buoyed by cautious optimism surrounding expected trade discussions between President Trump and President Xi Jinping. The prospect of easing tariff tensions continues to partially counterbalance persistent macroeconomic concerns, including inflation uncertainties, softening consumer demand, and subdued international trade activity. Treasury yields have remained broadly stable, contributing to a supportive backdrop for credit market dynamics.

Credit market participants remain cautiously optimistic, carefully weighing trade dialogue prospects against broader macroeconomic and policy uncertainty, particularly from evolving Federal Reserve guidance emphasizing patience amid balanced risks.

**Bottom Line**

IG credit spreads narrowed slightly to 54.96 bp, reflecting balanced investor sentiment underpinned by cautious optimism around forthcoming trade discussions.
