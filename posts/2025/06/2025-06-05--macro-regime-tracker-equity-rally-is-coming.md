**Macro Overlay**

The S&P 500 index closed down -0.18%, primarily pressured by sharp declines in Energy and Utilities sectors amid renewed global growth concerns and declining bond yields. Communication Services provided a rare positive offset, signaling investor rotation into select defensive names. Weak economic reports, including the contractionary ISM Services reading and lower-than-expected ADP payroll gains, raised speculation about potential Fed rate cuts, reinforcing caution.

**Bottom Line**

The S&P 500 edged lower by -0.18%, with pronounced weakness in Energy and Utilities sectors partially offset by strength in Communication Services. It now more important to closely track upcoming economic data releases and Federal Reserve communications, preparing for potential volatility amid growing macroeconomic uncertainty.

**Current Spread:** 55.16 bp (▲ ~0.2 bp d/d), reflecting slight widening. The current spread remains below the 5-year historical average (~63.2 bp), but indicates growing investor caution in response to recent weaker-than-expected economic data.

*   **< 60 bp:** Stable, duration-friendly range supporting insurance and liability-driven investment (LDI) strategies.
    
*   **60–70 bp:** Neutral-to-cautious positioning recommended amid tariff uncertainties and macroeconomic volatility.
    
*   **\> 90 bp:** Significant market distress—currently unlikely without a major escalation in geopolitical or macroeconomic shocks.
    

Today's slight widening in IG credit spreads to 55.16 bp highlights increased caution stemming from disappointing economic reports, notably the unexpected contraction in the US services sector and significantly weaker-than-expected private-sector payroll growth. These developments underscore ongoing concerns about the resilience of the US economy amidst elevated tariff impacts and broader macroeconomic uncertainties. Treasury yields moved lower, reflecting increased expectations for potential Federal Reserve easing later in the year, which partially mitigates credit market risks.

The market remains watchful, balancing optimism around potential easing in trade tensions with sustained vigilance regarding evolving economic indicators and central bank policy signals.

**Bottom Line**

IG credit spreads widened modestly to 55.16 bp, signaling heightened caution in light of recent economic weakness. Close monitoring of economic data, trade negotiations, and Federal Reserve communications is recommended for guidance on market direction.
