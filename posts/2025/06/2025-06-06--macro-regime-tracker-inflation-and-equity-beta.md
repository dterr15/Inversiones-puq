I want to cover several ideas post-market close as we head into NFP. You can see the bond views here:

First, the selling in the index today occurred with the Russell outperforming. Why? Because TSLA and the indexation effect helped drag down ES.

Second, Russell outperforming against the Dow (green), crude, and inflation swaps have been moving in lockstep. This is a key relationship to note because if the Russell does outperform marginally from here then it is a confirmation about inflation expectations.

Third, the distribution for NFP is below. We are ending a week after the hawkish comments from Lagarde. I would not be surprised to see some hedges unwind and put a bottom in BTC since it has been deviating from equities on a short-term basis.

_**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_

**Sector-by-Sector Contribution Snapshot (Weighted Impact)**

*   **Information Technology (-0.31 pp)** – Largest negative contributor, significantly impacted by a steep decline in Tesla shares (-14%), following intensified disputes between Trump and Elon Musk over subsidies and tax policies.
    
*   **Consumer Discretionary (-0.24 pp)** – Major drag due to heightened investor caution around consumer spending amid tariff uncertainty and declining consumer sentiment.
    
*   **Consumer Staples (-0.06 pp)** – Modest negative contribution, reflecting cautious market sentiment despite the sector’s traditionally defensive stance.
    
*   **Financials (-0.06 pp)** – Negatively impacted by falling bond yields and rising economic uncertainties following softer employment data and tariff-induced inflation concerns.
    
*   **Communication Services (-0.05 pp)** – Contributed negatively, despite earlier strength, weighed down by general market anxiety and tariff-related uncertainties.
    
*   **Industrials (-0.03 pp)** – Mildly negative impact, as investors reacted cautiously to weaker manufacturing data and ongoing tariff disruptions.
    
*   **Energy (-0.02 pp)** – Slight negative contributor, pressured by concerns over global economic growth and uncertain energy demand outlook.
    
*   **Materials (-0.02 pp)** – Marginally negative, impacted by tariff concerns and ongoing economic uncertainty despite stable commodity prices.
    
*   **Real Estate (-0.00 pp)** – Virtually flat, as yield-oriented appeal was offset by broader market caution and interest rate uncertainty.

*   **Industrials (-0.03%)** – Slightly weaker amid manufacturing softness and ongoing tariff-related supply chain issues.

**Macro Overlay**

The S&P 500 declined -0.81%, heavily influenced by significant weakness in Information Technology—particularly Tesla, following a high-profile dispute between Trump and Musk. Concurrently, broader market sentiment deteriorated amid weaker-than-expected employment data, rising unemployment claims, and escalating tariff-related inflation concerns highlighted by Fed officials including Adriana Kugler and Jeff Schmid. These developments fueled speculation about potential Fed rate cuts, intensifying caution in markets.

**Bottom Line**

The S&P 500 experienced a pronounced drop of -0.81%, primarily pressured by sharp declines in Technology and Consumer Discretionary sectors amidst heightened political tensions, weak economic indicators, and escalating tariff uncertainty. Wise to maintain vigilant regarding upcoming economic data releases, Federal Reserve signals, and developments in trade policy, preparing for continued market volatility.

**Current Spread:** 55.66 bp (▲ ~0.5 bp d/d), marking a modest increase in spreads. Though still below the 5-year historical average (~63 bp), the current widening reflects increasing investor caution in response to recent disappointing economic data and heightened tariff-related uncertainties.

*   **< 60 bp:** Stable, duration-friendly range supporting insurance and liability-driven investment (LDI) strategies.
    
*   **60–70 bp:** Neutral-to-cautious positioning recommended amid tariff uncertainties and macroeconomic volatility.
    
*   **\> 90 bp:** Significant market distress—currently unlikely without a major escalation in geopolitical or macroeconomic shocks.
    

Today's modest widening in IG credit spreads to 55.66 bp aligns with increased market caution stemming from recent soft economic indicators, sentiment has been negatively impacted by elevated uncertainty surrounding tariffs, reinforced by cautious commentary from Federal Reserve officials including Governor Adriana Kugler and Kansas City Fed President Jeff Schmid, who underscored inflation risks and potential economic drag from persistent tariffs.

Treasury yields declined amid these concerns, bolstering market expectations of potential rate cuts by the Federal Reserve later this year, somewhat tempering broader credit market risks.

Markets remain cautiously optimistic about further trade negotiations between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping but continue to closely monitor developments for any tangible resolutions.

**Bottom Line**

US IG credit spreads have widened slightly to 55.66 bp, underscoring increased investor caution amid weakening economic data and ongoing tariff uncertainties. Keep a good eye on upcoming economic releases, Federal Reserve communications, and developments in trade talks to inform positioning and risk management strategies.
