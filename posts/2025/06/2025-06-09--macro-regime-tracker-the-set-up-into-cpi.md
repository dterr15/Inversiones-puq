**Macro Overlay**

The S&P 500 dipped slightly by 0.02%, primarily weighed down by continued weakness in Information Technology and Financials despite notable strength in Consumer Discretionary. Investors cautiously monitored ongoing US-China trade talks aimed at easing tensions around tech exports and rare earth materials. Inflation expectations moderated further, easing slightly across all horizons according to the latest New York Fed survey, but economic uncertainties continued to weigh on market sentiment. Additionally, improved labor market sentiment partially offset concerns, with consumer confidence in job prospects modestly improving despite broader caution.

**Bottom Line**

The market closed marginally lower, highlighting caution amid persistent trade uncertainties, sectoral divergences, and evolving economic outlook. Continued vigilance remains essential, particularly around technology and financial sectors, as market participants seek clarity from ongoing trade discussions and upcoming economic data releases.

**Current Spread:** 53.91 bp (▼ ~1.6 bp d/d), indicating a modest narrowing of spreads. The current level remains below the 5-year historical average (~63 bp), suggesting cautious investor optimism despite persistent macroeconomic uncertainties.

*   **< 60 bp:** Stable, duration-friendly range supporting insurance and liability-driven investment (LDI) strategies.
    
*   **60–70 bp:** Neutral-to-cautious positioning recommended amid tariff uncertainties and macroeconomic volatility.
    
*   **\> 90 bp:** Significant market distress—currently unlikely without a major escalation in geopolitical or macroeconomic shocks.
    

The slight tightening in IG credit spreads to 53.91 bp reflects cautiously improved investor sentiment amid selective stabilization in economic indicators, tempered by ongoing concerns about trade tensions. Treasury yields displayed mixed responses, reflecting tempered expectations of potential Federal Reserve rate cuts later this year.

Remain attentive to ongoing US-China trade discussions, assessing implications from potential agreements or escalations in tariffs following recent constructive but cautious talks between Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping.

**Bottom Line:**

US IG credit spreads modestly tightened to 53.91 bp, illustrating caution alongside tentative optimism. It is wise to maintain vigilance regarding upcoming economic releases, Federal Reserve communication, and developments in trade negotiations to effectively manage risk exposure.
