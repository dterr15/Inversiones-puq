Investors responded positively to encouraging comments from Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicating productive progress in US-China trade negotiations.

Long-term yields saw limited movement, suggesting cautious market sentiment ahead of key inflation and trade-related developments.

Current Spread: 53.09 bp (▼ ~1.6 bp d/d), indicating further modest tightening. The spread remains comfortably below the 5-year historical average (~63 bp), underscoring investor optimism despite continued macroeconomic uncertainties.

*   **< 60 bp:** Stable, duration-friendly range supporting insurance and liability-driven investment (LDI) strategies.
    
*   **60–70 bp:** Neutral-to-cautious positioning recommended amid tariff uncertainties and macroeconomic volatility.
    
*   **\> 90 bp:** Significant market distress—currently unlikely without a major escalation in geopolitical or macroeconomic shocks.
    

The IG credit spread tightening to 53.09 bp reflects improved investor sentiment supported by positive signals from recent US-China trade discussions led by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Worth remaining cautiously optimistic, awaiting key economic data releases, particularly the imminent US inflation report, expected to reflect modestly higher inflation from tariff-driven cost pressures. Treasury yields exhibit restrained moves, aligning with tempered expectations regarding Federal Reserve rate actions for the remainder of the year.

Remain attentive to trade dialogue developments, inflation data, and upcoming Federal Reserve communications for prudent risk management.

Bottom Line:

US IG credit spreads tightened slightly to 53.09 bp amid growing optimism on constructive US-China trade discussions. Continued vigilance is crucial given ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties, particularly around inflation outcomes and central bank guidance.
