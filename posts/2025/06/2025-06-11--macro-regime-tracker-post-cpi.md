**Macro Overlay**

The S&P 500 declined by 0.44%, pressured primarily by significant weakness in Consumer Discretionary and Information Technology sectors. The session saw cautious trading despite Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick signaling continued progress in US-China negotiations. Markets were tempered by softer-than-expected inflation data, suggesting companies continue to absorb tariff costs without significant consumer pass-through, maintaining investor caution.

**Bottom Line**

Market sentiment dipped, predominantly driven by sector-specific concerns in technology and consumer-oriented sectors. Despite optimism in energy, broader caution prevails as investors weigh ongoing trade developments and key economic data releases.

**Current Spread**: 53.27 bp (▼ modest tightening), below the 5-year historical average (~62.94 bp). Current spread indicates sustained investor comfort despite broader macroeconomic uncertainty.

*   **< 60 bp:** Stable, duration-friendly range supporting insurance and liability-driven investment (LDI) strategies.
    
*   **60–70 bp:** Neutral-to-cautious positioning recommended amid tariff uncertainties and macroeconomic volatility.
    
*   **\> 90 bp:** Significant market distress—currently unlikely without a major escalation in geopolitical or macroeconomic shocks.
    

The narrowing of US IG credit spreads to 53.27 bp points toward a stable market environment underpinned by recent constructive trade negotiations between the US and China. Treasury market volatility remains subdued, aligning with tempered expectations for Federal Reserve rate actions amidst modest inflation figures.

Remain watchful for ongoing developments from trade talks, forthcoming inflation data, and Fed communications, ensuring balanced risk management.

**Bottom Line**:

Credit spreads continue to reflect a cautiously optimistic market stance, tightening slightly to 53.27 bp. Vigilance remains essential given ongoing uncertainties tied to macroeconomic developments and central bank policies.

**Key Takeaways (Latest OIS-Implied Pricing)**

**First-Cut Timing:**

*   **30-Jul-25:** Probability modest at 18.4% for a 25 bps rate cut, signaling cautious market expectations.
    
*   **18-Jun-25:** Remains highly unlikely at just 0.4%, reflecting persistent caution.
    
*   **17-Sep-25:** Rising conviction, currently at 61.6% probability for at least one rate cut, indicating robust market sentiment.
    

**Front-Loaded Easing Path:**

*   **10-Dec-25:** Implied rate now at 3.836%, highlighting cumulative easing of approximately –49.4 bp (~2 cuts) by year-end 2025.
    

**Longer-term Easing Expectations:**

*   **28-Oct-26:** Projected implied rate of 3.307%, suggesting cumulative easing of around –102.3 bp from the current effective rate of 4.330%.
    

**Macro Context:**

Sentiment remains cautiously optimistic amid encouraging progress in US-China trade discussions led by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Recent softer-than-anticipated US inflation readings further bolster market expectations for moderate Federal Reserve easing. Core inflation's subdued growth suggests limited immediate pressure on the Fed to become hawkish, aligning market sentiment toward potential rate cuts later in the year.

Treasury yields continue reflecting subdued volatility, consistent with cautiously optimistic market conditions supported by recent constructive trade developments and tempered inflation expectations.

**Bottom Line:**

Market expectations for rate cuts have notably strengthened, particularly for December 2025, supported by sustained optimism from trade discussions and easing inflation pressures. Continued vigilance remains necessary around future inflation data and central bank communications to effectively manage evolving market positioning.
