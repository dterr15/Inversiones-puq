_**The Macro Regime Tracker offers a daily lens on how shifts in growth, inflation, and liquidity affect short-term risk and reward. Leveraging machine learning, AI, and cross-asset data, it identifies macro changes and their impact on market positioning.**_

We are seeing fairly significant geopolitical risk get priced into markets. I posted a redundancy plan breakdown for crude in the chat earlier today:

_**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_

**Sector-by-Sector Contribution Snapshot (Weighted Impact to Index)**

*   **Information Technology (+0.28 pp)** – Top contributor as optimism in AI and cloud-related earnings (e.g., Oracle) lifted sentiment.
    
*   **Financials (+0.08 pp)** – Boosted by easing rate pressures and strong Treasury demand.
    
*   **Health Care (+0.06 pp)** – Steady contributor amid stable inflation outlook and improving capex sentiment.
    
*   **Industrials (+0.04 pp)** – Gained modestly, benefiting from soft inflation and rising capital investment narratives.
    
*   **Consumer Staples (+0.04 pp)** – Defensive bid continued despite broader risk-on tone.
    
*   **Energy (+0.03 pp)** – Supported by oil volatility and renewed geopolitical tension.
    
*   **Utilities (+0.03 pp)** – Defensive flows persist, though trailing broader gains.
    
*   **Materials (+0.02 pp)** – Lifted slightly by easing dollar and sentiment tied to China trade.
    
*   **Consumer Discretionary (+0.01 pp)** – Flat-to-positive, as traders rotate out of cyclicals cautiously.
    
*   **Real Estate (+0.01 pp)** – Minor contribution amid bond yield compression.
    
*   **Communication Services (–0.03 pp)** – Only drag on the index, led lower by risk-off positioning in select media and telecom names.
    

**Sector-by-Sector Performance Snapshot (Unweighted Returns)**

*   **Utilities (+1.13%)** – Top performer as investors embraced rate-sensitive, high-yielding sectors.
    
*   **Energy (+0.86%)** – Traded higher as Mideast risks intensified and long-end yields retreated.
    
*   **Information Technology (+0.86%)** – Solid earnings momentum (e.g., Oracle) pushed sector leadership.
    
*   **Consumer Staples (+0.63%)** – Broad gains on defensive positioning and stable consumer margins.
    
*   **Health Care (+0.63%)** – Benefited from strong managed care performance and capex optimism.
    
*   **Financials (+0.55%)** – Supported by bond rally and soft inflation encouraging easier Fed stance.
    
*   **Industrials (+0.43%)** – Helped by improved forward capex expectations and declining input costs.
    
*   **Materials (+0.41%)** – Stronger alongside weaker USD and trade détente hopes.
    
*   **Real Estate (+0.41%)** – Rally continued with falling yields and sticky rent pricing.
    
*   **Consumer Discretionary (+0.07%)** – Underperformed broader move as retailers remain cautious.
    
*   **Communication Services (–0.36%)** – Only declining group, dragged by weak streaming/media sentiment.
    

The **S&P 500 closed up 0.55%**, marking its highest finish since February 20. Gains were broad-based but led by **Information Technology** and **Utilities**, as markets absorbed soft inflation data and a blockbuster $22B long-end (30yr) Treasury auction. The muted May **PPI print (+0.1%)** reinforced expectations that the **Fed can afford to remain on hold** or cut if necessary.

President **Trump’s repeated calls for lower rates**, paired with dovish positioning and a **falling equity risk premium**, boosted rate-sensitive sectors. Meanwhile, **geopolitical tensions** escalated in the Middle East with the US evacuating non-essential embassy personnel amid **Iran-Israel risks**, lending support to Energy stocks.

Sentiment also benefited from strong corporate updates, with **Oracle hitting record highs** and renewed corporate **capex signals** from firms like Meta and Micron. However, insider selling reached levels last seen in November, suggesting some caution near the market’s highs.

**Current Spread:** 53.85 bp (▼ modest tightening), below the 5-year average of ~62.93 bp. Levels remain within a historically stable zone, signaling continued investor comfort despite persistent macro and geopolitical noise.

*   **< 60 bp:** Stable, duration-friendly range supporting insurance and liability-driven investment (LDI) strategies.
    
*   **60–70 bp:** Neutral-to-cautious positioning recommended amid tariff uncertainties and macroeconomic volatility.
    
*   **\> 90 bp:** Significant market distress—currently unlikely without a major escalation in geopolitical or macroeconomic shocks.
    

*   **Treasury strength:** A strong $22B long-bond auction eased concerns about fiscal crowding out. Yields at the long end declined sharply, reinforcing the duration bid.
    
*   **Inflation still tame:** May’s PPI rose just 0.1%, undershooting expectations and underscoring a multi-month stretch of soft inflation. This keeps the Fed on hold—and the door open to easing if needed.
    
*   **Fed policy inertia:** With both CPI and PPI prints coming in below forecast, markets are increasingly pricing in at least one rate cut later this year. This has provided a backstop to duration-heavy credit.
    
*   **Geopolitical risk:** Middle East tensions remain elevated, but have yet to materially impact credit pricing. Market focus remains on Oman-hosted US–Iran nuclear talks this weekend.
    

Credit markets continue to lean cautiously optimistic, with IG spreads tightening to **53.85 bp**—the lowest levels since early April. The move reflects a benign inflation backdrop, robust Treasury demand, and resilient equity sentiment. Despite geopolitical flare-ups and active insider selling in equities, credit remains well-behaved.

See the intro published for how to use the Mag7 models here: [Link](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/mag7-models-positioning-and-macro)

**First-Cut Timing:**

*   **18-Jun-25:** All but ruled out, with only a **0.4%** probability for a 25 bp cut.
    
*   **30-Jul-25:** Market pricing **22.4%** probability for the first cut — still cautious.
    
*   **17-Sep-25:** Conviction building, now **69.2%**, suggesting markets see this as the likely policy pivot point.
    

**Front-Loaded Easing Path (2025):**

*   **10-Dec-25:** Implied rate at **3.807%**, suggesting **–52.3 bp** of cumulative easing (~2 cuts).
    
*   **Full-Year 2025:** Market now pricing **~2 full cuts** between July and December.
    

**Longer-Term Easing Expectations (2026):**

*   **28-Oct-26:** Implied rate at **3.245%**, signaling cumulative cuts of **–108.5 bp** from the current effective rate of **4.33%**.
    
*   Pricing reflects **~4 full 25 bp cuts** by Q4 2026, with terminal rate expectations drifting lower as inflation cools and policy patience extends.
    

Markets continue to lean dovish amid:

*   **Soft inflation prints:** May PPI came in at just **+0.1% m/m**, following a similarly tame CPI earlier this week. There’s growing confidence the Fed can sit tight or begin easing later this year.
    
*   **Strong Treasury demand:** A well-bid $22B long bond auction helped anchor front-end volatility and reinforce confidence in US duration, even amid deficit concerns.
    
*   **Geopolitical backdrop:** Elevated tension in the Middle East (US–Iran–Israel dynamic) hasn’t yet destabilized rate markets, though it's contributing to mild bid into duration and gold.
    
*   **Fed outlook:** Trump reiterated frustration with the pace of Fed cuts but also confirmed he won’t fire Chair Powell. Meanwhile, swap markets are pricing ~50–55 bp of cuts by year-end 2025, and nearly 110 bp by end-2026.
    

OIS pricing reflects **growing confidence in easing**, with the first meaningful cut now firmly expected by **September**, and **~2 full cuts priced by December**. Beyond that, markets expect a **measured, extended easing cycle** through 2026. The combination of **benign inflation, constructive Treasury flows, and subdued front-end volatility** is keeping rate expectations anchored.
