We are about to enter FOMC and there is still a high degree of uncertainty. I laid out the redundancy plans for this week specifically focusing on how we are not at a point to short crude yet. We have seen NG rally though as the risk has remained elevated. (Report [LINK](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/trade-write-ups-geopolitical-risk))

_**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_

The S&P 500 gave back Monday’s gains, falling 0.50% as geopolitical risks escalated and traders grew more cautious ahead of this week’s central bank decisions. With oil spiking to fresh YTD highs and risk appetite fading resulting in unwounding of positions in growth and defensives alike. The move reflected a classic risk-off tilt, amplified by weak US retail sales, falling industrial production, and surging crude volatility.

*   **Information Technology (–0.14 pp)** – The largest drag on the index, with chipmakers and software broadly weaker amid valuation pressure and geopolitical unease.
    
*   **Health Care (–0.11 pp)** – Defensive names failed to attract support, led lower by biotech and pharma under pressure from policy noise.
    
*   **Consumer Discretionary (–0.11 pp)** – Gave back leadership as retail names were hit by soft consumption data and shifting sentiment.
    
*   **Communication Services (–0.05 pp)** – Underperformed, as media and streaming names saw profit-taking.
    
*   **Industrials (–0.04 pp)** – Marginally weaker on macro growth concerns and fading defense sector momentum.
    
*   **Consumer Staples (–0.03 pp)** – Modest drag as investors rotated away from low-beta sectors.
    
*   **Materials (–0.01 pp)** – Marginally negative; metals and miners tracked weaker global demand signals.
    
*   **Utilities (–0.01 pp)** – Offered no refuge as yields stayed firm and traders exited haven trades.
    
*   **Financials (–0.00 pp)** – Flat on the day despite yield curve dynamics.
    
*   **Real Estate (–0.00 pp)** – Duration-sensitive names stayed heavy amid rate pressure.
    
*   **Energy (+0.02 pp)** – The lone positive contributor, with oil-linked names supported by the surge in crude.
    

*   **Energy (+0.55%)** – Strongest sector, driven by WTI rallying 4.4% as Middle East conflict escalated and traders hedged tail risks.
    
*   **Information Technology (–0.45%)** – Broad weakness in semiconductors and software after recent outperformance.
    
*   **Health Care (–1.15%)** – Worst performing sector, with a sharp rotation out of defensive names despite volatility.
    
*   **Consumer Discretionary (–1.04%)** – Hit by retail weakness and fading growth sentiment.
    
*   **Communication Services (–0.55%)** – Down as ad-based names and telcos slid.
    
*   **Utilities (–0.53%)** – Continued unwind of rate-sensitive defensives.
    
*   **Materials (–0.59%)** – Pulled lower by commodity weakness and global demand concerns.
    
*   **Consumer Staples (–0.46%)** – Followed the broad move out of defensives.
    
*   **Industrials (–0.44%)** – Struggled alongside soft IP data and geopolitics.
    
*   **Financials (–0.01%)** – Flat, with banks caught between rates and macro nerves.
    
*   **Real Estate (–0.24%)** – Slipped further on duration sensitivity and no sign of yield relief.
    

**Geopolitics**  
Markets recoiled as President Trump’s demands for Iran’s “unconditional surrender” stoked fears of broader US involvement in the Israel-Iran conflict. Despite earlier signs of containment, headlines around potential strikes on Tehran and heightened military activity reignited concern.

**Oil**  
WTI crude surged 4.4%, closing near $75 a barrel, as traders positioned for potential disruptions around the Strait of Hormuz. Volatility in crude markets hit a three-year high, and options flow suggests traders are aggressively hedging for upside risk.

**Fed Outlook**  
Retail sales fell 0.9% in May — the steepest drop this year — while industrial production declined again. The data underscored growing consumer strain and a fading manufacturing pulse. Yet with oil surging, the inflation picture remains clouded ahead of Wednesday’s FOMC. Markets still expect no change in June or July, but Powell’s tone and dot plot will be pivotal.

**Bond Market**  
10Y Treasuries initially rallied but closed slightly weaker at 4.39%, pricing in both safe-haven demand and long-end fatigue. Meanwhile, the USD surged, with the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index up 0.5% — its biggest jump in a month.

**Current Spread:** 56.82 bp  
**5-Year Average:** 62.89 bp

**Status:** Firmly within the pre-COVID stability range, marking a continued vote of confidence in macro containment and policy predictability despite rising global tension.

*   **< 60 bp:** Stable, duration-friendly range supporting insurance and liability-driven investment (LDI) strategies.
    
*   **60–70 bp:** Neutral-to-cautious positioning recommended amid tariff uncertainties and macroeconomic volatility.
    
*   **\> 90 bp:** Significant market distress—currently unlikely without a major escalation in geopolitical or macroeconomic shocks.
    

*   **Geopolitical Risk Not Yet Disruptive**  
    Markets absorbed Israel’s intensified military actions and President Trump’s demand for Iran’s “unconditional surrender” with surprising calm. Spreads have not widened — a testament to confidence that the situation, while volatile, remains geographically contained and unlikely to impact global credit fundamentals or supply chains.
    
*   **Oil Rips, But Inflation Path Unchanged (So Far)**  
    WTI jumped 4.4% to $74.92 — the highest since January — and crude volatility reached a 3-year high. Yet the market is distinguishing between transient commodity shocks and structural inflation. Unless oil sustains >$80, IG credit remains insulated. Energy IG issuers even benefit from the price action.
    
*   **Weak Economic Data Adds to Rate-Cut Bets**  
    Retail sales fell 0.9% MoM and industrial production slipped for the second time in three months. Homebuilder confidence also hit the lowest since 2022. Despite a resilient control group reading (+0.4%), the softness in demand supports the case for Fed easing. Markets are now pricing in two cuts for 2025 — with the first fully priced by October.
    
*   **Fed Preview: Patience + Dovish Lean?**  
    The FOMC is expected to hold this week, but the focus is on updated dot plots and Powell’s guidance. With inflation softening and real activity wobbling, even a marginal dovish tilt could drive inflows into IG as a carry-friendly alternative to volatile equity or HY.
    

As shown in the attached chart, IG spreads are tracking inside their long-run average and remain far from the volatility of 2022 or the COVID spikes of 2020. At 56.82 bp, we are closer to 2017–2018 “Goldilocks” levels than any recent stress regime — and this despite rising oil, dollar strength, and ongoing global political frictions.

See the intro published for how to use the Mag7 models here: [Link](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/mag7-models-positioning-and-macro)

**Market Pricing Summary (Latest OIS-Implied Path):**

Markets are sharpening their expectations for Fed cuts, pricing a full **107.3 bp** of easing by the end of October 2026. The probability of a first cut by **September 2025** has climbed further, while 2026 is now expected to deliver the bulk of the easing cycle — even as geopolitical stress and oil price volatility rise.

**First-Cut Timing:**

*   **18-Jun-25:** Functionally unchanged at 4.33% (–0.1 bp), with just a **0.4% chance** of a cut — no live risk.
    
*   **30-Jul-25:** Pricing shifts slightly, with a **14.4% probability** of a 25 bp cut (–3.6 bp). Still not a strong base case.
    
*   **17-Sep-25:** **Conviction builds** — markets now assign a **56.4% chance** to a 25 bp cut (–17.8 bp), solidifying **September as the expected liftoff point**.
    

**Front-Loaded Easing Path (2025):**

*   **10-Dec-25:** Implied rate sits at **3.860%**, pricing in a cumulative **–47.0 bp** of easing through year-end — just shy of two full cuts.
    

**Longer-Term Easing Expectations (2026):**

*   **28-Oct-26:** Terminal policy rate priced at **3.257%**, reflecting total expected easing of **–107.3 bp** from the current 4.33%.
    
    *   That implies **four full 25 bp cuts**, with the bulk expected to occur in **H1 2026**:
        
        *   28-Jan-26 (–54.2 bp total)
            
        *   29-Apr-26 (–74.7 bp total)
            
        *   29-Jul-26 (–95.2 bp total)
            

*   **Geopolitical Volatility High, but Contained**  
    Despite direct missile exchanges between Iran and Israel, and President Trump’s aggressive stance ("UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER"), markets are treating the conflict as **contained**.
    
*   **Oil Spike Not Derailing Easing Path**  
    WTI crude closed at $74.92/bbl (+4.4%), yet the curve still leans heavily toward easing. Traders are betting that unless energy prices remain elevated into Q3, **the inflation shock will remain transitory**.
    
*   **Data Weakness Adds to the Cut Case**  
    Retail sales fell 0.9% in May — the worst monthly reading of the year — with consumer demand softening under the weight of tariffs and inflation anxiety. Industrial production also dipped 0.2%, and homebuilder sentiment dropped to its lowest since December 2022. The **macro tone has turned cautious**, giving the Fed breathing room.
    
*   **Fed Outlook: No Move This Week, But Dovish Dots Likely**  
    Markets expect **no change at the June FOMC**, but focus is squarely on Powell’s tone and the Summary of Economic Projections. With inflation easing and economic data rolling over, the Fed is **in no rush**. September is the logical starting point for cuts — and the market is confidently leaning that way.
    

The short-end remains grounded in a base case of **"September start, slow and steady thereafter."**

*   Roughly **two cuts** priced for 2025
    
*   Total of **–107.3 bp** priced by October 2026
    
*   **No front-loading**, no panic — just a smooth, quarterly rhythm of easing unless oil or core inflation re-accelerates
    

Amid rising geopolitical stress and fragile consumer confidence, the STIR complex continues to look through the noise — leaning on soft data, Fed patience, and policy normalization by Q4.

The Fed may not pre-commit — but the **market already has.**
