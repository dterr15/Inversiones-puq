_**The Macro Regime Tracker offers a daily lens on how shifts in growth, inflation, and liquidity affect short-term risk and reward. Leveraging machine learning, AI, and cross-asset data, it identifies macro changes and their impact on market positioning.**_

*   Macro Regime Context
    
*   Macro Tear Sheets: Equities, Fixed Income, FX, Crypto, and Commodities
    
*   Macro Regime Dashboard: Excel spreadsheet for economic data and interest rates
    
*   Growth, Inflation, Fixed Income, Credit, and Equities Regime Tracker
    
*   AI and Machine Learning Strategies - Macro Regime and Positioning Premiums Strategies: S&P 500, 2-Year Interest Rates, Gold, and Bitcoin
    

I have been consistently laying out in the reports on Capital Flows that equities remain skewed to the upside. I also recorded a video today explaining HOW these flows are functioning:

We have been compressing in this range for ES during the geopolitical risk, but the underlying macro regime continues to show a growing economy. When you compress in a range like this from geopolitical risk and then that risk decreases, equities rally:

This is exactly what happened today with the announcement by Trump:

The news about Iran trying to bomb a US base caused crude to sell off aggressively from the highs, retracing the entire move from the geopolitical risk. From here, we could bounce marginally but its clear that crude is likely to remain below these highs for the time being.

What is going to happen? This will be laid out further in the report for paid subscribers, but I want to draw your attention to one specific dynamic. We are pricing over 50bps of cuts for this year by the Fed in the Z5 SOFR contract. In my view, it is going to be incredibly difficult to price 75bps. It is still unclear of how much of the bid in bonds was purely from the geopolitical risk or how much is already pricing what comes after the higher crude prices make their way into headline CPI.

Needless to say, understanding interest rates will be critical for the next 90 days.

_**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_
