_**The Macro Regime Tracker offers a daily lens on how shifts in growth, inflation, and liquidity affect short-term risk and reward. Leveraging machine learning, AI, and cross-asset data, it identifies macro changes and their impact on market positioning.**_

I laid out the macro views for WHERE we are going here:

Powell’s testimony today continues to show that they are opting for inaction even though they know inflation will rise marginally. This inaction is allowing growth to run hot and further fueling upside in equities. The mistake in this is that when the Fed falls behind, they will eventually have to over correct to get back on course.

**Main Developments In Macro**

*   **Powell (Testimony Highlights):**
    
    *   "We do expect tariff inflation to show up more"
        
    *   "Don’t think we need to rush to cut with economy strong"
        
    *   "Majority feels it's appropriate to cut later this year"
        
    *   "Lower inflation, weaker labor could mean earlier cut"
        
    *   "Tariff pass-through may be less than expected — that matters"
        
    *   "Strong economy means Fed can pause a bit"
        
    *   "Story has been evolving, our thinking adapting"
        
    *   "We don’t take political factors into consideration"
        
    *   "Credibility on price stability very important"
        
    *   "Don’t know how much cost will be passed to consumers"
        
*   **Williams (NY Fed):**
    
    *   "Inflation is on track outside of tariffs"
        
    *   "Market response to tariffs has calmed a bit"
        
    *   "Expect GDP growth to slow to ~1%"

    *   "Expect inflation to rise due to tariffs"

    *   "Fed can afford to wait, policy well-positioned"
        
*   **Hammack (Cleveland Fed):**
    
    *   "Inflation trend is encouraging, but progress very slow"
        
    *   "Need more watching before rate cuts"

    *   Trump told Netanyahu not to expect further US offensives
        
*   **Iran Signals Diplomacy:**
    
    *   “We seek fair and reasonable agreement under intl law”
        
    *   “Ready to resolve issues with US based on intl frameworks”

    *   Will respect ceasefire as long as Iran does
        
    *   Lifting home front wartime restrictions

_**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_
