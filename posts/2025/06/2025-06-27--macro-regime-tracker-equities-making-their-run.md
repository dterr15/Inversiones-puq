I have been laying out the bullish view of equities for some time now. We are now seeing the realization of it as ES is almost at an all time high and the Russell outperforms today. See the original report here:

The most up-to-date views on bonds are here:

Market participants were extrapolating the downside in equities so much on short term geopolitical that they forgot how much money is in the actual system.

_**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_
