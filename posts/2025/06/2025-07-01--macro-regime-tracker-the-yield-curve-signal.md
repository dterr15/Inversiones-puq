Today is the final day of the quarter, which means whatever rebalancing flows that needed to be accomplished have been put through, and we are now entering Q3. These flows likely added a little bit of a bid to bonds over the last couple of days. The macro constraints I laid out in the Macro Report continue to be my base case for WHERE we are moving.

The 10s30s yield curve continues to steepin in a manner that indicates MORE growth ahead as opposed to a recession (see thread I wrote here: [link](https://x.com/Globalflows/status/1939762591007703092)).

As I laid out in the macro report ([link](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/comprehensive-macro-report-global)), the focus on recession continues to be a theme the media pushes even though the evidence for it is anecdotal.

If you understand the dynamics of the yield curve, you can have a much clearer understanding of WHERE all major risk assets are moving. I have put together a playbook that comprehensively explains these factors as they relate to recession risk. The playbook is here:

The final point I want to make is that the rest of this report is sent out every day with all of the major models I review every day. It pulls together every major economic and market data point, runs it through our machine learning and AI process to correctly frame HOW to think about the current regime. If you have a macro view, you want a continuous feed of information and models to consistently provide color for WHAT is taking place so you can evaluate your thesis in an informed manner.

_**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_

Here’s the **updated S&P 500 Sector Wrap** using the latest sector contribution and performance data, contextualized within Powell’s testimony, ongoing tariff uncertainty, and growing market fatigue near record highs:

The S&P 500 edged up 0.17% Tuesday, capping its strongest quarter since late 2023, as a modest rotation into defensive sectors supported the index amid ongoing trade deal speculation and restrained rate expectations. While participation was narrower than prior sessions, Real Estate, Utilities, and Financials helped offset weakness in Consumer Discretionary and Communication Services. Treasuries firmed, the dollar slid to fresh lows, and macro data stayed mixed all reinforcing a “cut later, not never” backdrop.

**Sector Contribution Breakdown (Weighted Return to Index)**

*   **Financials (+0.07 pp)** – Top contributor as bank stocks extended gains post-stress test, with flatter curves supporting carry dynamics.
    
*   **Information Technology (+0.07 pp)** – Solid bid in hardware and enterprise software, offsetting weakness in semiconductors.
    
*   **Health Care (+0.05 pp)** – Continued rotation into managed care and large-cap pharma names.
    
*   **Industrials (+0.04 pp)** – Lifted by strength in logistics and defense.
    
*   **Consumer Staples (+0.03 pp)** – Supported by multinational staples as tariff risks moderated.
    
*   **Real Estate (+0.02 pp)** – REITs rallied on lower yields and signs of stabilizing rate expectations.
    
*   **Utilities (+0.02 pp)** – Gained on falling rates and rising volatility protection demand.
    
*   **Materials (0.00 pp)** – Flat session; metal strength offset by chemical softness.
    
*   **Energy (–0.01 pp)** – Slight drag as crude oil dipped below $65.
    
*   **Communication Services (–0.05 pp)** – Platform names faded after recent strength; some pullback in telco.
    
*   **Consumer Discretionary (–0.09 pp)** – Largest drag; weakness in e-commerce and travel names post strong Q2 run.
    

**Sector Performance Breakdown (Unweighted Index Returns)**

*   **Utilities (+0.93%)** – Best performer as defensive positioning resurged.
    
*   **Real Estate (+0.88%)** – Led by REITs and commercial property amid yield decline.
    
*   **Health Care (+0.57%), Consumer Staples (+0.51%)** – Solid defensive rotation continued.
    
*   **Financials (+0.48%), Industrials (+0.48%)** – Steady follow-through in cyclicals; banks and transports firmed.
    
*   **Materials (+0.26%)** – Lifted modestly by metals and packaging.
    
*   **Information Technology (+0.21%)** – Broader sector gain masked chip softness.
    
*   **Energy (–0.28%)** – Lower oil prices weighed despite relative calm in the Middle East.
    
*   **Communication Services (–0.54%)** – Profit-taking in ad tech and media names.
    
*   **Consumer Discretionary (–0.82%)** – Sharpest drop, led by autos, travel, and retail.
    

**Macro Overlay: Window Dressing, Defensive Bid, and Trade Deadlines Loom**

1.  **Quarter-End Flows Favored Rate-Sensitive Plays**
    
    *   With Q2 closing, month-end rebalancing favored Real Estate and Utilities amid declining Treasury yields.
        
    *   Treasury Secretary Bessent emphasized that longer-dated issuance would remain restrained, reinforcing bullish bond tone.
        
2.  **Bostic Flags Sticky Tariff Pass-Through, But Cuts Still in View**
    
    *   Atlanta Fed’s Bostic warned tariff-driven inflation could be “slow and persistent,” yet maintained a baseline view for one cut in 2025 and three more in 2026.
        
    *   Fed remains divided, with dovish voices growing louder, while Powell stays noncommittal.
        
3.  **Trade Diplomacy Shifts Gears**
    
    *   Canada dropped its digital services tax to restart trade talks, with a July 21 target date set.
        
    *   The EU now appears open to Trump’s 10% universal tariff proposal in exchange for sector-specific exemptions.
        
    *   The July 9 US trade deadline with key partners still looms as a material macro event.
        
4.  **Economic Data Remains Mixed, But Not Derailing**
    
    *   Chicago PMI: 40.4 vs 43.0 est → signals ongoing weakness in regional manufacturing.
        
    *   Dollar index hit lowest level since March 2022.
        
    *   Treasuries rallied further, pushing the 10-year yield down to 4.24%.
        

**Final Word: Rotation Signals Defense, Not Distress**

Tuesday’s modest gain capped a historic Q2 for the S&P 500, with a defensive tilt emerging as markets digest valuations, geopolitics, and tariff policy risks. Breadth narrowed, and leadership shifted to rate-sensitive names, signaling growing caution without broader risk-off pressure. With trade deadlines, inflation reports, and earnings season ahead, the setup into July remains asymmetric and sensitive to any surprises on the jobs or tariffs front.

**Current Spread: 51.06 bp | 5-Year Average: 62.87 bp**

US investment-grade (IG) credit spreads eased slightly to 51.06 bp, slipping back toward multi-year tights as investors stayed pinned to a cautious, data-watching posture. Despite strength in equities and a historic quarter-end for the S&P 500, IG credit markets remain tethered to soft consumption data, policy ambiguity, and a lack of conviction around trade execution. The macro fog rather than fear is keeping spreads rangebound near post-COVID lows.

*   **< 60 bp:** Stable, duration-friendly range supporting insurance and liability-driven investment (LDI) strategies.
    
*   **60–70 bp:** Neutral-to-cautious positioning recommended amid tariff uncertainties and macroeconomic volatility.
    
*   **\> 90 bp:** Significant market distress currently unlikely without a major escalation in geopolitical or macroeconomic shocks.
    

1.  **Consumer Fatigue Stands Out**
    
    Real personal consumption fell 0.3% in May the steepest decline YTD—while income declined 0.4% and savings dipped to 4.5%. These trends reinforce a weakening domestic demand backdrop, especially in services and discretionary segments. This dynamic undercuts the case for spread compression, even as equities press higher.
    
2.  **Powell & Bostic Emphasize Patience Over Panic**
    
    Chair Powell reiterated the Fed’s “luxury of time,” while Atlanta Fed’s Bostic acknowledged that tariff pass-through might be “slow but sticky,” implying sustained pressure on prices. Both continued to frame July as too soon, reinforcing the September base-case cut. The broader FOMC remains split but not reactive.
    
3.  **Trade Diplomacy Ramps, but Enforcement Lags**
    
    Canada officially repealed its digital tax to restart negotiations with the US, while the EU signaled willingness to accept a 10% universal tariff pending exemptions for key sectors. Despite these headline wins, enforcement credibility and structural impact remain murky.
    
4.  **Inflation: Stable, but Not Settled**
    
    Core PCE (May): +0.2% m/m | +2.7% y/y  
    UMich 1Y/5Y inflation expectations: down to 5.0% and 4.0%, respectively
    
    While headline prints were firm, expectations eased. Services inflation slowed, durable goods deflation resumed. The IG market sees the backdrop as supportive for carry, but not yet compelling enough to drive duration extension.
    

**Final Word: Credit Anchored, Not Chasing**

At 51.06 bp, US IG spreads are reflecting a market that’s clear-eyed about macro risk, but not fearful. There’s little momentum for further compression with consumers slowing, the Fed stuck in wait-and-see, and the trade story long on headlines but short on substance.

See the intro published for how to use the Mag7 models here: [Link](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/mag7-models-positioning-and-macro)

Traders continue to lean into the Fed’s eventual pivot, with OIS now pricing –135.1 basis points of cumulative rate cuts by December 2026 a fresh cycle low for implied terminal policy. Chair Powell offered little fresh guidance in his latest remarks, maintaining a cautious, data-dependent posture. But with consumption faltering, tariff risk contained, and the labor market showing signs of softening, the market is already moving ahead of the Fed’s language.

**Front-End Expectations**

*   **01-Jul-25:** 4.330% → No live risk
    
*   **30-Jul-25:** 4.283% (–4.7 bp) → ~19% probability → July still live but not base case
    
*   **17-Sep-25:** 4.043% (–24.0 bp) → ~96% probability → September cut now fully priced
    

**Year-End 2025 Outlook**

*   **10-Dec-25:** 3.656% → –66.4 bp cumulative → Market sees roughly 2.5 cuts by year-end
    

**Full Cycle**

*   **09-Dec-26:** 2.979% → –135.1 bp → Market now fully committed to lower-for-longer glide path
    

**1\. Powell Stays Careful, Market Keeps Moving**

Chair Powell remained non-committal, emphasizing “uncertainty” around tariff pass-throughs and cautioning against premature action. His stance continues to anchor expectations around September, with the market pricing July as an optional tail risk.

> “We’re in no rush... but if inflation stays contained, we’ll adjust.”

**2\. Consumer Cracks Deepen, Growth Narrative Softens**

*   **May Personal Spending:** –0.3% m/m → weakest of 2025
    
*   **May Personal Income:** –0.4% m/m → sharpest drop since 2021
    
*   **Savings Rate:** Down to 4.5% → thinnest household buffer in years
    
*   **Q1 GDP:** Revised to –0.5% annualized → dragged by services
    

The data increasingly suggest domestic demand is sputtering. The Fed can afford to wait, but the market sees little reason for delay beyond optics.

**3\. Trade De-escalates as Canada, EU, China Make Progress**

*   **Canada:** Dropped digital tax → bilateral talks resume
    
*   **EU:** Poised to accept 10% universal tariff framework with carve-outs
    
*   **China:** Rare earths deal finalized; further agreements expected post-July 4
    

These developments ease tariff anxiety without stoking inflation risk. Powell called the tariff effects “hard to model” a reason to wait, but not to tighten.

**4\. Inflation Still Contained**

*   **May Core PCE:** +0.2% m/m | +2.7% y/y
    
*   **UMich Inflation Expectations:** 1Y: 5.0% ↓ | 5–10Y: 4.0% ↓
    

Sticky services remain an issue, but forward-looking expectations are easing. No data suggests the Fed is behind the curve quite the opposite.

*   **September remains base case (~96% probability)**
    
*   **July stays alive, but lacks momentum (~19% chance)**
    
*   **Cumulative easing of –135.1 bp now priced**
    

Markets have moved ahead of Powell’s script. Credit is tight, consumers are fading, and inflation is behaving. Powell may be waiting for confirmation, but traders are already pricing the outcome a steady glide path lower, beginning this fall.
