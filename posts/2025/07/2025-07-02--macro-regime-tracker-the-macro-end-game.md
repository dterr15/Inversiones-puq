_**The Macro Regime Tracker offers a daily lens on how shifts in growth, inflation, and liquidity affect short-term risk and reward. Leveraging machine learning, AI, and cross-asset data, it identifies macro changes and their impact on market positioning.**_

*   Macro Regime Context
    
*   Macro Tear Sheets: Equities, Fixed Income, FX, Crypto, and Commodities
    
*   Macro Regime Dashboard: Excel spreadsheet for economic data and interest rates
    
*   Growth, Inflation, Fixed Income, Credit, and Equities Regime Tracker
    
*   AI and Machine Learning Strategies - Macro Regime and Positioning Premiums Strategies: S&P 500, 2-Year Interest Rates, Gold, and Bitcoin
    

Today I recorded a video explaining HOW the last 40 years have set the stage for WHERE we are moving in interest rates. You can find the full video here:

I want to share several additional things for you to keep an eye on:

*   First, whenever you have a regime change, there is a shift in cross sectional momentum (relative performance of assets) and correlations (assets moving together or inversely). The chart below shows ES (red) and then the Z score of bonds of their various durations vs ES (other colored lines). When the colored lines are moving up, stocks are falling against bonds. When the colored lines are moving down, ES is rallying against bonds. Why does this matter? You will notice that over the last 2 weeks, ES has been rallying aggressively against bonds. The implication is that even during the marginal rally in bonds since the last CPI print, equities continue to outperform. The signal you want to take away from this is that WHEN a recession begins to occur, ES will fall against bonds as implied volatility blows out.

*   Second, we are compressing at a lower level in both the VIX and MOVE Index. This is setting the stage for the next move. (I laid out the logic for these moves in the macro report: [LINK](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/comprehensive-macro-report-global))

This is reflected in the RSP/SPY spread today, where broad equities rallied significantly more than Mag7:

The takeaway is that we are in the process of consolidating at a higher level in equities. I am watching the Nikkei and Yen closely here as we are in the Asia session because the Yen rallied as the Nikkei pulled back marginally from the high.

As I shared in the Macro End Game Video, this chart says a lot about the longer term trend. The Russell is rallying as 10s30s is steepening. The shorter term signals are important to take not of on an incremental basis but these flows are indicating strength in the economy.

The NFP print this week is likely to further confirm what the JOLTS print told us, that growth remains resilient.

_**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_

Here’s the **updated S&P 500 Sector Wrap** using the latest sector contribution and performance data, contextualized within Powell’s testimony, ongoing tariff uncertainty, and growing market fatigue near record highs:

The S&P 500 closed up 0.17% on Wednesday, sustaining momentum into the new quarter despite mounting trade noise and sticky price signals. A notable rotation away from recent winners particularly tech and communications fueled gains in lagging sectors like Health Care, Materials, and Consumer Discretionary. Rate-sensitive groups remained broadly firm, while Treasury yields ticked higher following stronger-than-expected ISM and JOLTS data.

**Health Care (+0.14 pp)** – Top contributor, driven by managed care and pharma; defensive and growth narratives overlapped amid macro uncertainty.  
**Consumer Discretionary (+0.14 pp)** – Rebounded strongly from Tuesday’s lag, led by autos and retail.  
**Financials (+0.11 pp)** – Continued strength in banks and diversified financials as carry tailwinds held.  
**Industrials (+0.06 pp)** – Lifted by transport and defense; saw catch-up after underperformance.  
**Materials (+0.04 pp)** – Bid returned to metals and specialty chemicals as inflation protection plays.  
**Energy (+0.03 pp)** – Modest gain despite crude volatility, driven by refiners and integrateds.  
**Consumer Staples / Real Estate (+0.02 pp each)** – Mild outperformance on rate stability and shelter bid.  
**Utilities / Info Tech (0.00 pp / –0.29 pp)** – Utilities tread water, while tech dragged on the index with sharp pullbacks in semis and mega-cap software.  
**Communication Services (–0.08 pp)** – Second consecutive day of weakness in ad platforms and telecom.

**Materials (+2.22%)** – Best performing sector on broad strength across miners, packaging, and chemicals.  
**Health Care (+1.45%)** – Managed care, biotech, and pharma names surged.  
**Consumer Discretionary (+1.37%)** – Strong bounce led by autos and travel after prior day’s drag.  
**Energy (+0.86%), Financials (+0.75%), Real Estate (+0.75%)** – Broad cyclical participation continued.  
**Industrials (+0.65%)** – Steady grind higher in capex-sensitive names.  
**Consumer Staples (+0.39%), Utilities (+0.20%)** – Defensive bid steadied, but no longer driving leadership.  
**Information Technology (–0.89%)** – Heaviest drag; chipmakers underperformed alongside software fade.  
**Communication Services (–0.82%)** – Selloff extended in ad tech and media.

**1\. Powell Stays Cautious, Won’t Rule Out July**

Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that July is “not off the table” but emphasized a wait-and-see approach as tariffs complicate the inflation outlook. He noted inflation is behaving “exactly as expected,” and confirmed a solid majority at the Fed still see cuts later this year. Rate cuts remain a matter of timing, not direction.

**2\. Manufacturing Signals Stress**

ISM Manufacturing rose to 49.0 (vs. 48.8 est), but new orders and employment deteriorated. Companies are accelerating headcount reductions and reporting demand uncertainty tied to tariff volatility. The index for prices paid surged to 69.7 — highlighting persistent upstream pressures even as consumption slows.

**3\. Trade Risks Amplify as July 9 Nears**

Trump stated there will be no extension of the tariff pause, raising the prospect of renewed levies on Japan and others. Canada repealed its digital services tax to salvage negotiations, and the EU is angling for exemptions under a universal tariff framework. The White House is pushing to finalize a suite of bilateral agreements in the coming week.

**4\. Rates Firm as Job Market Resilient**

May JOLTS showed 7.77M job openings well above estimates dimming the odds of near-term Fed easing. Treasuries sold off modestly, with 10s rising to 4.25%. The labor market remains tight, complicating the Fed’s tradeoff calculus.

The S&P 500’s modest gain masks a powerful undercurrent: leadership is shifting fast, breadth is rotating, and sector dispersion is widening. With small caps outperforming and defensives stabilizing, this market is increasingly reliant on rotation not conviction for forward progress. The setup into the July 9 tariff deadline and July 15 CPI release remains tactically bullish but strategically cautious.

**Current Spread: 50.56 bp | 5-Year Average: 62.83 bp**

Investment-grade (IG) credit spreads continued to grind tighter, falling to 50.56 bp their lowest since early 2024 as credit markets maintained a slow, cautious drift tighter in the face of macro ambiguity. While equity markets remain choppy and heavily rotational, the IG space remains rooted in a carry-friendly, wait-and-see posture. The market isn’t chasing risk, but it's also not fading it, as rate volatility stabilizes and fundamentals show more fatigue than fear.

*   **< 60 bp:** Stable, duration-friendly range supporting insurance and liability-driven investment (LDI) strategies.
    
*   **60–70 bp:** Neutral-to-cautious positioning recommended amid tariff uncertainties and macroeconomic volatility.
    
*   **\> 90 bp:** Significant market distress currently unlikely without a major escalation in geopolitical or macroeconomic shocks.
    

**1\. Powell Holds Ground, July Still Live**

Chair Powell repeated his “patient but flexible” stance, saying July is “not off the table,” but inflation uncertainty tied to tariffs means the Fed prefers more data before acting. While the market remains priced for a September cut, Powell’s rhetoric reinforced optionality rather than urgency.

**2\. ISM Shows Manufacturing Still Contracting, Employment Weakens**

June’s ISM Manufacturing Index rose modestly to 49.0, but new orders and employment dropped further, with the latter falling for a fifth straight month. The price paid index surged to 69.7, reflecting cost pressure despite flagging demand. From a credit lens, this mix continues to support carry, not credit expansion.

**3\. Trade Talks Progress, but Clarity Lags**

The US and Canada reset talks after Canada repealed its digital services tax, and the EU is signaling willingness to accept a 10% universal tariff framework. Still, enforcement timelines, sector carve-outs, and implementation risk remain uncertain ahead of the July 9 deadline.

**4\. Jobs Data Resilient, but Market Still Bets on Cuts**

The JOLTS report showed job openings rose to 7.77 million the highest since November reinforcing the Fed’s “luxury of time” narrative. The labor market remains solid, keeping July cuts unlikely. However, market pricing for two cuts by year-end is largely intact.

Spreads at 50.56 bp reflect a credit market sitting in a constructive middle ground skeptical of overexuberance in equities, but also unthreatened by the near-term macro path. The backdrop of mixed manufacturing, stable inflation expectations, and cautious policymaker tone means credit remains anchored — not widening on risk, but not compressing without conviction either.

See the intro published for how to use the Mag7 models here: [Link](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/mag7-models-positioning-and-macro)

The front-end of the curve softened marginally Tuesday, with cumulative rate cuts priced through December 2026 pulling back to –122.9 basis points, from –135.1 bp the prior day. The shift comes as OIS markets recalibrate around improving risk sentiment, a rebound in the dollar, and firm labor market signals. Still, the path to a Fed pivot remains largely intact: a September cut is nearly fully priced, July remains in the discussion, and Powell's cautious stance continues to anchor expectations, even as traders front-run the FOMC's formal signaling.

**Front-End Expectations**

*   **02-Jul-25:** 4.330% → No live risk
    
*   **30-Jul-25:** 4.278% (–5.2 bp) → ~21% probability → Optional, not expected
    
*   **17-Sep-25:** 4.050% (–22.8 bp) → ~91% probability → September still base case
    

**2025 Year-End Outlook**

*   **10-Dec-25:** 3.686% → –64.4 bp cumulative → Market still sees 2–3 cuts this year
    

**Full Cycle View**

*   **09-Dec-26:** 3.101% → –122.9 bp cumulative → Lower-for-longer path persists despite tactical pullback
    

**1\. Powell Remains Non-Committal but Doesn’t Push Back on Cuts**

Chair Powell repeated that July is not off the table, but his comments in Sintra reinforced a “wait-and-see” posture. He acknowledged tariff-driven inflation may yet materialize but said the Fed is “prepared to learn if the impact is higher or lower, or later or sooner.” The tone keeps optionality open while still biasing toward September as a pivot point.

**2\. Job Openings Surprise Higher, Labor Still Strong**

May JOLTS: 7.77M job openings vs. 7.3M est → highest since Nov

This data reinforces the “luxury of time” Powell cited, but also increases the bar for a July cut. Wages are holding, unemployment remains low, and layoffs have slowed — all suggesting the Fed is not pressured to act immediately.

**3\. Consumer Still Wobbly, But Not Collapsing**

*   Personal Spending (May): –0.3% m/m
    
*   Personal Income: –0.4% m/m
    
*   Savings Rate: Down to 4.5%
    

While the jobs market holds, consumption remains a soft spot — raising questions about household resilience heading into H2. Powell framed this as manageable, but the market views it as early justification for easing.

**4\. Trade Talk Tensions Ease Without Reflation**

*   Canada: Repeals digital tax → US negotiations resume
    
*   EU: Open to 10% universal tariff structure with carve-outs
    
*   China: Rare earths deal finalized
    

These de-escalations reduce the risk of global inflation shocks. Powell noted trade is “hard to model,” but the market is increasingly convinced it won’t be a Fed-blocking inflation impulse.

While the cumulative implied cuts slipped to –122.9 bp, the trend remains firmly dovish. September is the anchor, July is still in view, and no data including the stronger JOLTS print is hot enough to derail the easing narrative. Powell’s approach is patient and deliberate, but traders continue to price an eventual unwind that starts sooner rather than later. The recent risk-on rotation and stable inflation prints give the Fed room — and the market confidence to price cuts, even if the Fed isn’t ready to say it out loud.
