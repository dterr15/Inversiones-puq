_**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_

The S&P 500 rose 0.45% in Thursday’s abbreviated pre-holiday session, extending its rally to new all-time highs. Leadership narrowed further with big tech, financials, and energy doing the heavy lifting, while defensives lagged. A stronger-than-expected June payrolls report helped reinforce confidence in the macro backdrop, cooling immediate rate-cut hopes but supporting a “resilient growth” narrative into earnings season. Markets shrugged off tariff uncertainties as headlines quieted and the Vietnam deal took hold.

*   **Financials (+0.12 pp)** – Top contributor as steepening curves and upbeat macro tone lifted banks and insurers.
    
*   **Information Technology (+0.22 pp)** – Broad follow-through after Wednesday’s AI-led gains; Microsoft, Apple, and semis firmed.
    
*   **Industrials (+0.04 pp)** – Logistics and defense names extended strength amid infrastructure optimism.
    
*   **Communication Services (–0.01 pp)** – Slight drag as telecoms slipped; platforms mixed.
    
*   **Utilities (+0.02 pp)** – Marginal gains as yield-sensitive sectors held firm despite higher rates.
    
*   **Energy / Consumer Discretionary / Staples (0.01 pp each)** – Steady session; oil helped E&Ps, while staples found footing after recent softness.
    
*   **Health Care / Materials / Real Estate (0.00 pp)** – Directionless amid holiday thinness.
    

*   **Financials (+0.88%)** – Best performing sector as Treasury curve steepened and rate fears faded slightly.
    
*   **Info Tech (+0.66%)** – Continued strength in AI-linked names and chipmakers.
    
*   **Industrials (+0.50%)**, **Energy (+0.42%)** – Cyclicals supported by macro optimism and crude stability.
    
*   **Utilities (+0.72%)** – Defensive buying persisted despite firm yields.
    
*   **Discretionary (+0.13%)**, **Staples (+0.24%)**, **Materials (+0.12%)** – Mixed across sub-sectors; no dominant themes.
    
*   **Health Care (+0.03%)**, **Real Estate (+0.11%)** – Stabilized after recent volatility.
    
*   **Comm Services (–0.08%)** – Lagged slightly as ad-tech consolidation paused.
    

**1\. June Jobs Report: Upside Surprise, But Details More Mixed**

*   Headline NFP: +147k vs 106k expected
    
*   Unemployment: Fell to 4.1%, driven partly by a drop in participation
    
*   Private payrolls: +74k → weakest since Oct
    
*   Wages: +0.2% m/m, slowing from May
    

While the headline beat, internals were less robust. Still, the report affirmed a solid labor market, enough to push back against a July cut but not hot enough to derail easing expectations entirely.

**2\. Market Repricing Pushes September Back to “Soft Base Case”**

*   Odds of July cut faded to near-zero
    
*   September still in view (~70% chance), but more data needed
    
*   Treasuries sold off (2Y yield +10 bp to 3.88%)
    
*   Dollar firmed; equity futures held gains
    

**3\. Tariff Backdrop Quiet as Vietnam Deal Takes Shape**

Trump’s Vietnam accord continues to be received positively, with 0% US import levies and 20% on Vietnamese exports to the US. Broader trade uncertainty remains, but markets appear confident inflation risks are contained.

**4\. Tech and Financials Reclaim Leadership**

Tech megacaps remain the market’s engine, with financials benefiting from the curve’s steepening. Cyclicals followed, while defensives mostly lagged. Participation narrowed, but leadership stayed strong.

The S&P 500’s grind higher reflects a market betting on durability: in growth, in margins, and in AI tailwinds. Thursday’s jobs report helped cool near-term cut expectations but reinforced soft-landing hopes. With the Fed firmly on hold until September and the tariff calendar quiet for now, equities enter Q3 with momentum though valuations and positioning are beginning to matter more. Inflation prints on July 15 and earnings next week are the next key catalysts.

**Current Spread: 49.31 bp | 5-Year Average: 62.81 bp**

Investment-grade credit spreads narrowed further Thursday to 49.31 basis points—just six ticks above post-pandemic cycle tights—as markets absorbed mixed macro signals with calm resolve. Strong headline job growth, fading July cut expectations, and tariff de-escalation kept carry strategies in favor, even as under-the-surface labor metrics and fiscal overhangs cloud the outlook.

*   **< 60 bp**: Duration-friendly, carry-positive zone for insurers, pensions, and liability-driven buyers.
    
*   **60–70 bp**: Macro noise threshold, where volatility or inflation threats prompt positioning cuts.
    
*   **\> 90 bp**: Systemic stress unlikely unless global macro or geopolitical shocks return.
    

**1\. Payrolls Surprise to Upside, But Labor Details Mixed**

*   NFP: +147k vs. 106k est; Unemployment: 4.1%
    
*   Private Payrolls: +74k → slowest since Oct
    
*   Participation Rate: Fell to 62.4% → second monthly drop
    
*   Wages: +0.2% m/m → softer than expected
    

The surface data appear strong enough to delay Fed easing until fall. But soft internals—especially in services and participation—support IG’s carry-centric drift as rate volatility remains capped.

**2\. Powell Keeps Patience Message Alive**

Chair Powell stuck to the familiar “wait-and-see” script post-payrolls, acknowledging tariff risks and mixed inflation signals. Markets now price a near-0% chance of a July cut and ~70% for September.

→ Credit sees this as a green light to stay long, not leverage up.

**3\. Trade Frictions Ease, But Policy Ambiguity Lingers**

The US-Vietnam deal eliminating US-bound tariffs and introducing transshipment penalties boosted market clarity—but enforcement risks remain. Canada’s soft reset and the EU’s 10% tariff framework add to the sense that trade policy may stabilize, not shock.

Still, implementation timelines and residual uncertainty limit conviction in tighter credit pricing from here.

**4\. Credit Anchored as Inflation Path Clouds Duration Conviction**

The ISM Manufacturing Index rose slightly to 49.0 but remained in contraction. Prices paid surged to 69.7—highest since 2022—highlighting upstream inflation friction even as employment and demand soften.

→ IG buyers remain duration-neutral: not reaching, not fading.

At 49.31 bp, spreads are brushing post-COVID lows—a level historically consistent with stable rate regimes, low realized volatility, and strong Fed credibility. Yet forward conviction is lacking. Labor data cracks, Powell’s patience, and election-year fiscal churn all suggest risk-taking in credit will stay modest and opportunistic rather than thematic. As inflation data and Q2 earnings roll in mid-month.

See the intro published for how to use the Mag7 models here: [Link](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/mag7-models-positioning-and-macro)

Markets continued to price a historically deep easing cycle despite trimming expectations post-NFP, with cumulative cuts through December 2026 now seen at –120.7 basis points, up modestly from –128.5 bp earlier in the week. The stronger-than-expected June payrolls report helped cool near-term cut bets, but soft private hiring, fading participation, and cautious Fed guidance kept the curve anchored to a lower-for-longer regime.

**Front-End Meetings**

*   **04-Jul-25:** 4.330% → No cut risk
    
*   **30-Jul-25:** 4.318% (–1.2 bp) → ~5% probability → July priced out post-NFP
    
*   **17-Sep-25:** 4.149% (–16.9 bp) → ~68% probability → September remains base case
    
*   **29-Oct-25:** 3.995% (–15.6 bp) → ~62% probability → Path flattens into Q4
    

**2025 Year-End Outlook**

*   **10-Dec-25:** 3.815% → –51.5 bp cumulative → Two cuts by year-end firmly priced
    

**Full Cycle Outlook**

*   **09-Dec-26:** 3.123% → –120.7 bp total → Terminal rate repriced slightly higher, but path remains long
    

**1\. Jobs Beat Masks Soft Internals**

The June NFP surprised to the upside at +147k vs. +106k est, and the unemployment rate dipped to 4.1%. But private hiring slowed to just +74k the weakest since October with service sector softness and a declining participation rate undermining the headline strength. Wage growth eased to +0.2%, with hours worked falling to 34.2.

→ A “Goldilocks” report that removes urgency but maintains the easing trajectory.

**2\. September Is Still the Anchor**

Despite the repricing, traders continue to favor a September start to the cycle. The curve now sees 1.5–2 cuts by year-end, with a shallow but persistent path through 2026. Market pricing shows conviction in a lower terminal rate below 3.2%.

**3\. Labor Cracks Justify Fed Patience**

Participation dropped again, and Challenger data signals structurally softer hiring. Immigration frictions, ADP’s –33k surprise, and declining average weekly earnings reinforce the argument that the labor market is stabilizing, not accelerating.

While implied cuts have been marked up slightly to –120.7 bp, the broader easing thesis remains undisturbed. The Fed is in no rush post-NFP, but consumer fatigue, ADP softness, and a declining labor force participation rate offer it cover to move by September. Unless inflation re-accelerates, the market’s lower terminal bias and confidence in the path looks increasingly durable.
