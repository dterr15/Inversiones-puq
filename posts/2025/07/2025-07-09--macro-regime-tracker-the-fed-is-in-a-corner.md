_**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_

The S&P 500 inched 0.12% lower Tuesday as investors digested intensifying tariff risk and rising long-end yields. While most sectors traded softly, Energy and Health Care outperformed, buoyed by Trump’s copper tariff push and renewed bid for defensive earnings. Markets appear to be entering a holding pattern near all-time highs ahead of July CPI, with fresh trade headlines keeping volatility surfaces elevated and participation narrow.

*   **Financials (–0.10 pp)** – Largest drag as rising long-end yields pressured banks amid limited risk-on appetite.
    
*   **Consumer Discretionary (–0.08 pp)** – Softness in retail and luxury goods on trade concerns and Prime Day margin compression.
    
*   **Communication Services (–0.07 pp)** – Platform names faded as ad-tech paused and media stocks faced tariff-linked uncertainty.
    
*   **Staples / Utilities (–0.02 pp to –0.01 pp)** – Light defensive pullback; rate moves offset fundamental support.
    
*   **Energy (+0.08 pp)** – Outperformed on copper tariff tailwind and broad materials strength.
    
*   **Health Care (+0.06 pp)** – Continued rotation into defensives; pharma headlines around tariff exemptions provided support.
    
*   **Tech, Materials, Real Estate (flat to +0.01 pp)** – Muted flows despite underlying resilience.
    

*   **Energy (+2.69%)** – Strongest gainer on the day, lifted by Freeport-McMoRan and materials names as copper surged.
    
*   **Health Care (+0.66%)** – Pharma led on speculation of delayed tariff application.
    
*   **Materials (+0.45%), Real Estate (+0.35%)** – Benefited from rate stabilization and commodity strength.
    
*   **Tech (+0.04%), Industrials (+0.04%)** – Flat-to-positive as global growth fears were balanced by firm macro data.
    
*   **Discretionary (–0.75%), Financials (–0.73%)** – Heaviest laggards as trade and yield fears weighed.
    
*   **Comm Services (–0.77%), Staples (–0.44%), Utilities (–0.23%)** – Broad underperformance across consumer- and yield-sensitive plays.
    

1.  **Tariff Deadline Unmoved**  
    Trump reiterated that the August 1 tariff start date is “firm but not 100%,” while his team continues to negotiate with over a dozen countries. Despite some late-stage deal optimism, uncertainty persists. Letters this week covered 90% of the US trade deficit, adding asymmetric headline risk.
    
2.  **Yields Grind Higher**  
    Treasuries weakened again, with the 10-year yield rising to 4.41% and the 30-year testing 5% for the first time since early May. Soft demand in front-end auctions and global curve shifts (notably in JGBs and bunds) contributed to pressure.
    
3.  **Markets Hold Near Highs As Internals Fade**  
    S&P breadth narrowed further, and the Magnificent 7 index edged down. Credit spreads remain well-anchored and vol curves are elevated but orderly. For now, equities are consolidating rather than capitulating.
    
4.  **CPI Next as Inflation Refocuses Fed Path**  
    The July 15 inflation print is the next major macro catalyst. Market pricing still leans toward a September cut, but tariff passthrough and any upside CPI surprise could challenge the path.
    

The S&P 500 is stalling just below its highs as policy risk competes with macro momentum. While copper, energy, and defensives are providing selective support, the broader market remains hostage to the outcome of trade negotiations and inflation data. Until CPI gives clarity, expect sideways grind, sector rotation, and increasing asymmetry in equity leadership.

**Current Spread: 51.23 bp | 5-Year Average: 62.83 bp**

Investment-grade credit spreads were little changed Tuesday, nudging wider by less than half a basis point to 51.23 bp. While still holding near post-pandemic tights, the market’s tone was noticeably less certain. A firm dollar, soft demand at Treasury auctions, and continued tariff overhang capped fresh inflows into high-grade credit, even as carry and stability remain broadly supportive.

*   **< 60 bp**: Duration-friendly, carry-positive zone for insurers, pensions, and liability-driven buyers.
    
*   **60–70 bp**: Macro noise threshold, where volatility or inflation threats prompt positioning cuts.
    
*   **\> 90 bp**: Systemic stress unlikely unless global macro or geopolitical shocks return.
    

**1\. Trump’s Tariff Clock Keeps Ticking**

President Trump reiterated that the August 1 tariff implementation is "firm but not 100% firm," with no intention to grant further delays. With 25%–40% levies spanning over a dozen trade partners, and sectoral actions pending on autos, chips, and pharma, the window for negotiation remains but risk premia have quietly begun to rise across risk assets.

Credit remains resilient but directional conviction is lacking as traders gauge whether the tariff reprieve strategy turns into prolonged volatility.

**2\. Treasuries Bear-Steepen Again as Long-End Demand Falters**

Yields rose across the curve, with the 10Y up to 4.41% and the 30Y nearing 5%. Soft demand at Tuesday’s 3-year note auction and spillover from JGB and bund weakness reinforced steepening pressure. That kept rate-sensitive IG names in check, particularly in housing, autos, and utilities.

At 51.23 bp, IG spreads are remarkably stable in historical context but not without friction. The tariff regime is now functioning as a volatility overhang: staggered threats, sector-specific escalation, and global trade frictions are raising headline sensitivity. The credit market hasn’t broken—but it’s no longer fading every shock either.

See the intro published for how to use the Mag7 models here: [Link](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/mag7-models-positioning-and-macro)

**Cumulative Implied Easing: –116.4 bp | September Cut Still Anchored**

The OIS-implied path for Fed policy remained firmly dovish Wednesday, with markets pricing –116.4 basis points of total cuts by December 2026. That’s a marginal rebound from the prior day’s –118.6 bp, reflecting slightly firmer back-end expectations. While July is still fully priced out, September remains the favored pivot. Market conviction in the lower terminal endures, even as trade tensions mount and real rates firm.

**Front-End Meetings:**

*   **09-Jul-25:** 4.330% → No live cut risk
    
*   **30-Jul-25:** 4.318% (–1.2 bp) → ~5% probability → Off the table barring a shock
    
*   **17-Sep-25:** 4.156% (–6.2 bp) → ~65% probability → Remains the base case
    
*   **29-Oct-25:** 4.012% (–14.4 bp) → ~58% probability → Still supportive of a shallow glide
    

**2025 Year-End Outlook:**

*   **10-Dec-25:** 3.837% → –49.3 bp total easing → Two cuts priced in with moderate confidence
    

**Cycle Terminal:**

*   **09-Dec-26:** 3.166% → –116.4 bp total → Terminal pricing still below 3.20%, despite inflation and tariffs
    

**1\. Tariff Countdown In Focus, Market Not Blinking Yet**

With Trump reaffirming his August 1 deadline for new reciprocal tariffs, markets continue to price risk conservatively not reactively. Rates remain anchored as investors treat the policy as a "negotiation lever" rather than a baseline inflation driver.

Still, some creep in back-end implied rates suggests the market is hedging against prolonged policy drift and soft Fed credibility.

**2\. Labor Data: Resilient Topline, Weak Guts**

Despite an upside NFP print last week (+147k), internals continue to deteriorate:

*   **Private payrolls:** +74k → slowest since Oct
    
*   **Participation:** 62.4% → second monthly drop
    
*   **Average workweek:** 34.2 hours
    
*   **Wage growth:** +0.2% m/m → slowing trend
    

The labor market continues to offer the Fed cover for optionality supportive of cuts, but not forcing urgency.

**3\. Powell Stays Cautious, But Political Pressure Builds**

Chair Powell’s messaging remains consistent: caution, data dependence, and tariff uncertainty. Meanwhile, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh called for urgent cuts and criticized institutional inertia, adding political noise to the otherwise muted policy debate.

Markets aren’t buying rate hikes or a hawkish reversal but September now needs confirmation through inflation prints and trade headlines.

At –116.4 bp, the easing trajectory is broadly unchanged lower-for-longer still rules. But as the August 1 tariff clock ticks louder, volatility is shifting from the front-end to the tail. September remains the fulcrum, and unless CPI surprises hotter or trade blows up, the market has no incentive to price anything more aggressive.

**What Matters Next:**

*   **CPI (Jul 15):** Services disinflation or reacceleration could tip the odds
    
*   **Tariff Deadline (Aug 1):** Policy risk becoming inflation risk?
    
*   **Fedspeak / Powell (Jul 17):** Market wants consistency, not new guidance
