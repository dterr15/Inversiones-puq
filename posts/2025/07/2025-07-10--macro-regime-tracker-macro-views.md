_**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_

The S&P 500 climbed 0.20% Wednesday, regaining footing after Tuesday’s tariff-induced wobble, as risk appetite firmed into the upcoming earnings season. Sector leadership shifted decisively toward defensives, utilities, and communication services, while prior winners like energy and staples underperformed. With Nvidia briefly topping a $4 trillion market cap and bond yields easing modestly, equities pushed higher despite lingering policy uncertainty and President Trump’s renewed focus on tariff enforcement.

*   **Information Technology (+0.09 pp)** – Leading contributor again as big tech momentum persisted ahead of earnings. Nvidia’s surge and Apple resilience helped.
    
*   **Communication Services (+0.05 pp)** – Broad-based strength with platform and media stocks firming amid easing headline risk.
    
*   **Health Care / Discretionary (+0.03 pp each)** – Outperformance from pharma and select retail names lifted both sectors.
    
*   **Utilities (+0.02 pp)** – Yield compression supported interest-sensitive names; steady inflows into defensives.
    
*   **Industrials (+0.01 pp), Materials (+0.00 pp)** – Flat-to-mild gains on improving demand sentiment.
    
*   **Staples / Real Estate / Financials (–0.00 to –0.03 pp)** – Minor drags; consumer staples in particular weighed by margins and rate worries.
    
*   **Energy (–0.01 pp)** – Gave back some recent tariff-linked gains as copper cooled.
    

*   **Utilities (+0.81%)** – Best performing sector as lower yields supported high-dividend names.
    
*   **Communication Services (+0.49%)** – Continued bounce in platforms and streaming.
    
*   **Consumer Discretionary (+0.33%), Health Care (+0.29%), Tech (+0.26%)** – Rotation into beta-light and earnings-resilient pockets.
    
*   **Materials (+0.19%), Industrials (+0.07%)** – Underlying strength but no breakout.
    
*   **Real Estate (–0.11%)**, **Energy (–0.30%)**, **Financials (–0.03%)**, **Staples (–0.55%)** – Dragged by yield stabilization and tariff discounting.
    

**1\. Tariff Risk Still Real, but Markets Decoupling (for Now)**  
Despite Trump reaffirming the August 1 tariff deadline and unveiling a 50% rate on Brazil, equity markets appear increasingly immune to trade headlines—at least temporarily. Tariff letters now cover 90% of the trade deficit, but expectations of negotiation progress remain, muting volatility.

**2\. Fed Minutes Highlight Inflation Divide**  
The FOMC minutes revealed a split over tariff-driven inflation risk, with most members concerned about longer-term price effects. Nonetheless, the market still sees two cuts this year, starting in September. Lower Treasury yields today supported equity multiples.

**3\. Earnings Season Now the Focus**  
With macro risks plateauing, attention turns to earnings. Mega-cap names continue to dominate flows. Nvidia's $4 trillion milestone highlights concentration, while breadth beneath the surface remains thin. Defensive positioning persists, but the “extreme greed” signal from the CNN Fear & Greed Index suggests optimism may be overextended.

**Final Word: Tariff Headwinds Muted for Now, Earnings Take the Wheel**

The S&P 500 is again leaning into tech, defensives, and utilities as the market shrugs off policy turbulence for now. Momentum is narrowing, but not breaking. With Nvidia and big tech powering the tape and Treasuries providing breathing room, equity bulls retain control ahead of earnings. That said, tariff risks and July CPI remain wildcards. Expect rotation, not retreat, until further catalysts emerge.

**Current Spread: 50.05 bp | 5-Year Average: 62.80 bp**

Investment-grade credit spreads tightened slightly to 50.05 basis points Wednesday, inching closer to post-pandemic tights despite a steady drumbeat of macro crosscurrents. While equities climbed on Nvidia’s $4 trillion milestone and receding long-end yields, credit markets were more restrained. The prevailing calm belies a landscape where tariff escalation, Fed uncertainty, and geopolitical frictions are quietly recalibrating risk premia beneath the surface.

*   **< 60 bp**: Duration-friendly, carry-positive zone for insurers, pensions, and liability-driven buyers.
    
*   **60–70 bp**: Macro noise threshold, where volatility or inflation threats prompt positioning cuts.
    
*   **\> 90 bp**: Systemic stress unlikely unless global macro or geopolitical shocks return.
    

**1\. Spreads Compress as Risk Markets Reassert Bullish Bias**  
Spreads tightened ~1 bp despite ongoing policy and geopolitical overhangs. IG credit continues to behave like a carry trade — stable, liquid, and resilient — but cracks are beginning to emerge in peripheral positioning and liquidity depth. Bid-ask spreads in lower-rated segments have widened slightly, suggesting hesitation beneath the surface calm.

**2\. Trump’s Tariff Blitz Rolls On, Credit Watches the Edges**  
With over 90% of the US trade deficit now under active tariff negotiation, including this week’s 50% rate threat on Brazil and a 10% warning for India over BRICS participation, the market is shifting from binary reactions to slow-drip repricing. So far, credit is not treating this as systemic — but longer-term corporate margin risks are being repriced, especially in auto, retail, and semiconductors.

**3\. Fed Split Widens as Tariff Inflation Enters the Room**  
FOMC minutes revealed a growing divide over how tariffs might impact inflation trajectories. While some policymakers see one-off effects, most fear stickier pass-throughs. The implication: the September cut remains base case, but anything resembling a CPI surprise next week could delay or dilute the easing cycle. Credit is treading carefully — flat curves and dovish expectations are built into pricing.

**4\. Treasury Rally Offers Temporary Relief to Credit Duration**  
Wednesday’s bond auction brought a reprieve, with 10-year yields falling to 4.34%. While positive for IG carry math, this was more a tactical pause than a structural reversal. The 30-year remains elevated, and curve steepening pressures haven’t gone away — especially if energy prices or tariffs push inflation expectations higher again.

At 50.05 bp, US IG spreads are hovering just above their lowest levels since 2018. But the risk-reward has subtly changed: tariff timelines are real, the Fed is increasingly split, and high-grade supply is expected to return post-earnings blackout. With macro volatility now a background hum rather than a shock event, credit is holding.

**Cumulative Implied Easing: –121.9 bp | Terminal Still Anchored Near 3.11%**

The OIS curve leaned more dovish Thursday, with markets now pricing in –121.9 basis points of rate cuts through December 2026 — a modest shift from –116.4 bp a day earlier. The move reflects stronger conviction in the post-September glidepath, despite persistent trade headlines and Powell’s steady tone. The Fed’s inflation hesitance remains, but markets are not waiting for formal guidance: the curve is increasingly confident that the easing cycle will proceed — if gradually.

**Front-End Meetings:**

*   **10-Jul-25: 4.330%** → Cut fully priced out
    
*   **30-Jul-25: 4.313% (–1.7 bp)** → ~7% probability → July remains sidelined
    
*   **17-Sep-25: 4.141% (–7.2 bp)** → ~69% probability → September firming as first cut
    
*   **29-Oct-25: 3.983% (–5.8 bp)** → ~63% probability → Additional follow-through priced
    

**2025 Year-End Outlook:**

*   **10-Dec-25: 3.798%** → –53.2 bp total easing → Two cuts priced in with moderate conviction
    

**Cycle Terminal:**

*   **09-Dec-26: 3.111%** → –121.9 bp total easing → Terminal below 3.15%, dovish trend restored
    

**1\. Market Digests Tariff Rhetoric Without Repricing Core Path**

Despite a barrage of tariff letters — including a newly announced 50% levy on Brazil — markets remain anchored to macro stability. Participants view Trump’s trade blitz as largely strategic posturing with inflation implications too murky to reprice the Fed path materially.

→ The tariff regime may matter later, but markets want to see CPI before reacting.

**2\. Powell Holds the Line as Fed Split on Inflation Risk Emerges**

FOMC minutes revealed a growing divide on the inflation impact of tariffs. While “most” policymakers worry about persistence, others see tariffs as one-off price bumps. Powell remains in the data-dependent camp. Fed Funds futures are now fully pricing in a September cut and leaning toward a second in December.

→ The market is increasingly front-running the Fed’s caution.

**3\. Soft Underlying Labor and Solid Treasury Demand Offer Cover**

Despite tight jobless claims and a resilient NFP headline, wage growth, participation, and private hiring data continue to flag. Meanwhile, a strong 10Y auction signaled underlying demand for duration, giving further comfort to the market’s dovish view.

→ Traders are betting the Fed can ease without stoking volatility.

With –121.9 bp of cuts now priced through 2026 and September seen as a near lock, the easing bias has resumed despite tariff rhetoric. Investors appear to be increasingly discounting trade shocks and inflation worries as short-term noise. All eyes now turn to July 15 CPI — the last major input before Powell speaks on July 17.

Unless CPI flares or trade rhetoric escalates into action, the market seems set on a lower-for-longer trajectory — and the Fed may need to catch up.
