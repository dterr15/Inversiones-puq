_**The Macro Regime Tracker offers a daily lens on how shifts in growth, inflation, and liquidity affect short-term risk and reward. Leveraging machine learning, AI, and cross-asset data, it identifies macro changes and their impact on market positioning.**_

Today I recorded a spaces on Twitter where I covered some of the top questions people have about how the macro regime is developing. You can find the recording here: [LINK](https://x.com/JoeCarlasare/status/1949908286649651666)

I also recorded a video explaining how the Fed fits into various stock bond correlation regimes: (the connected report is here: [LINK](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/when-the-fed-fights-the-market-who))

_**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_

The S&P 500 closed down 0.15% Monday in a session defined by sharp defensive underperformance and a market leaning more cautiously into the week’s macro gauntlet. Under the hood, the selloff was deceptively uneven: Tech and Energy rose, while Real Estate, Utilities, and Materials led a broad decline in rate-sensitive and tariff-exposed names. With investors front-running the Fed, the QRA, and a loaded week of earnings, the rotation turned sour beneath the surface.

**(Weighted Return Contribution to S&P 500)**

*   **Info Tech (+0.14 pp)** – Led the tape again, with semiconductors and AI hardware firms benefiting from stabilized supply chain sentiment and tariff carve-out hopes.
    
*   **Energy (+0.01 pp)** – Marginal support as oil rebounded on China tariff negotiation tailwinds and US-Russia supply squeeze rhetoric.
    
*   **Consumer Discretionary (+0.01 pp)** – Flat to slightly positive, supported by reopening trades and some continued resilience in auto and travel sub-sectors.
    

**Negative Contributors:**

*   **Financials (–0.08 pp)** – Underperformed amid curve flattening and renewed focus on Powell’s press conference risks.
    
*   **Health Care (–0.06 pp)** – Hit by uncertainty over Trump’s pharma tariff threats and drag from large-cap managed care.
    
*   **Industrials (–0.03 pp)** – Soft PMI tone and tariff-exposed machinery names dragged.
    
*   **Staples, Real Estate (–0.03 pp)** – Broad selling in bond proxy names.
    
*   **Comm Services (–0.04 pp)** – Media and ad-tech names weakened into regulatory risk headlines.
    
*   **Materials, Utilities (–0.02 pp each)** – Materials fell on EU tariff deal disappointment; Utilities sold as bond yields edged up.
    

**(Unweighted Daily Returns)**

*   **Energy (+0.45%)** – Best-performing sector, helped by firmer crude and lower US inventory chatter. Renewed optimism around China demand supported refiners and upstream.
    
*   **Info Tech (+0.41%)** – Strong showing led by chipmakers and software platforms. Nvidia and second-tier AI names continued to attract momentum inflows.
    
*   **Consumer Discretionary (+0.07%)** – Modest rise led by autos and entertainment, though housing names lagged.
    

**Broad Decliners:**

*   **Financials (–0.61%)** – Curve pressure weighed heavily, particularly on banks and insurers. Capital markets revenue concerns also lingered.
    
*   **Health Care (–0.66%)** – Pharma names came under pressure as tariff rhetoric heated up; biotech offered little support.
    
*   **Industrials (–0.33%)** – Tariff headlines spooked capital goods and construction names; logistics was flat.
    
*   **Materials (–0.88%)** – Weakest link among cyclicals. EU deal fallout raised concerns about cost absorption across chemicals and packaging.
    
*   **Real Estate (–1.41%)**, **Utilities (–0.97%)**, **Staples (–0.53%)** – Heaviest pressure on duration-sensitive sectors as Treasury yields nudged higher. Traders appear to be lightening up ahead of Powell’s remarks and upcoming supply.
    

**Tariff Reality Bites, Defensive Cracks Widen**

Despite a benign headline close, today's tape tells a more complicated story. Real Estate and Utilities sold off hard, foreshadowing nerves over this week’s **Fed decision** and Wednesday’s **Quarterly Refunding Announcement**. With the yield curve stable but elevated, and growing concerns that Powell could be pinned between political pressure and inflation inertia, bond proxies are now shouldering the duration load.

Meanwhile, **Trump’s EU tariff deal** is being met with quiet discontent across Europe and skepticism in US boardrooms. A 15% tariff baseline now feels like the floor, not the ceiling. Auto-exposed names and heavy exporters dragged, and **Materials** suffered in kind. The **China talks in Stockholm** are progressing, but details remain thin — and the specter of secondary sanctions and pharma tariffs lingers in the background.

**The rotation into cyclicals that held last week’s bid has turned fractured**, and now the S&P’s resilience rests on a narrow group of Tech and Energy names.

What looked like a quiet session on the surface revealed **deteriorating breadth** and growing macro fragility. As we head into Wednesday’s triple-header — **Fed decision, Powell presser, and QRA** — the market is increasingly bifurcated. **Tech strength is doing heavy lifting**, but with **defensives cracking and Financials under pressure**, there's little margin for disappointment.

Earnings remain strong, but **policy risk is taking center stage**. Whether it’s tariffs, the Fed’s employment mandate, or the market’s dependence on ultra-low volatility, this is a week where the narrative could shift sharply.

**Current IG Spread: 50.25 bp | 5-Year Avg: 62.74 bp | COVID High: 151.80 bp | Cycle Low: 43.75 bp**

Investment-grade spreads remain remarkably subdued, ticking tighter to 50.25 bp as markets cling to the "Goldilocks glidepath" in the face of intensifying macro crosscurrents. While rates push higher, tariffs loom, and Fed politics heat up, credit refuses to budge. This is not disinterest… It's either confidence or willful blindness. Either way, the floor is thin.

*   **< 60 bp**: Duration-friendly, carry-positive zone for insurers, pensions, and liability-driven buyers.
    
*   **60–70 bp**: Macro noise threshold, where volatility or inflation threats prompt positioning cuts.
    
*   **\> 90 bp**: Systemic stress unlikely unless global macro or geopolitical shocks return.
    

**Tariffs Move From Rhetoric to Risk**

Trump’s tariff agenda has evolved from negotiating tactic to near-certainty. The EU accepted a 15% baseline on exports, but auto, pharma, and chip names remain in the firing line and over 200 sector-specific tariff letters are expected this week. Meanwhile, US–China talks continue in Stockholm with some positive noise, but little substance. IG paper is not reacting… yet. That’s a spread mispricing waiting to happen.

**Rates Grind Up, But IG Ignores the Signal**

The 10-year yield is sitting above 4.40%, and the Treasury’s $1 trillion borrowing estimate has reshaped front-end rate expectations. Still, IG spreads are glued to the floor. The dislocation between nominal yields and credit spreads is growing more severe particularly for long-duration names. If Powell leans hawkish or QRA surprises with longer-duration issuance, spread duration will matter again.

**Fed Uncertainty No Longer Just About Policy**

Chair Powell’s political insulation is cracking. Multiple governors may dissent this week, and Trump’s building tour isn’t just theatrics it’s a signal. The market may be underestimating how quickly a shift in leadership or messaging could hit credit’s perception of Fed reliability. This is particularly acute for the belly and long end of the curve, where investors rely on forward policy clarity to justify tight spreads.

**Capex Slowdown Confirms Tariff Drag**

Core capital goods orders are falling, and durable goods prints are flashing red. Even before tariffs are fully implemented, companies are reacting to the uncertainty. This should weigh on IG issuance plans and future cash flow expectations particularly in industrials and materials. Yet for now, spreads reflect no deterioration in corporate creditworthiness. That divergence won’t hold if capex weakness accelerates.

Investment-grade credit remains stoic, but the backdrop is deteriorating. You have:

*   A trade regime entering a chaotic final stretch,
    
*   Long-end yields grinding higher,
    
*   Corporate investment pulling back.
    

All while IG spreads remain pinned below their historical mean.

This isn’t just tight… Iit’s tight **and brittle**.

The current level reflects **a market priced for perfect execution**, but the margin of error is vanishing. One misstep on tariffs, one hawkish tilt from Powell, or a weak earnings signal from a major industrial or tech name and these spreads will reprice sharply.

See the intro published for how to use the Mag7 models here: [Link](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/mag7-models-positioning-and-macro)

**Cumulative Implied Easing (to Oct 2026): –107.3 bp**  
**Terminal Rate: 3.257%**  
**September OIS Cut Probability: 64.0% | Implied Rate: 4.161%**

The short-end remains perched in a holding pattern, with cumulative easing priced at –107.3 bp effectively unchanged while the September cut probability clings to 64%. The curve is stable, but conviction is thin. With this week’s Fed decision and press conference looming, plus tariff headlines thickening around the US–EU deal and China talks, the market is braced but not budging.

[

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AIgX!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa75e1bba-bfa3-40a9-93c2-964d49a5fe53_330x249.png)

](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AIgX!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa75e1bba-bfa3-40a9-93c2-964d49a5fe53_330x249.png)

The market continues to assign a ~64% chance of a cut in September, but pricing has flattened at that level. The catalyst now lies squarely in **Wednesday’s Fed meeting and press conference**. Powell is expected to hold rates steady, but the language especially on growth risks, tariff pass-through, and labor softening will steer whether 64% becomes 80% or collapses to 40%. A hawkish lean could steepen the front end fast.

Despite a finalized EU deal and ongoing China negotiations, the tariff risk hasn't dissipated it’s metastasizing. Trump’s rhetoric is firming: 15% is the floor, not the ceiling. While Canada, the UK, and other holdouts negotiate, over 200 tariff notices are due this week. The curve still **doesn’t reflect much front-loaded inflation risk**, nor does it price a disruption in supply chains that could complicate rate cuts. That's a blind spot.

The **politicization of the Fed** continues to bubble. Trump’s visit to the central bank’s renovation site was more than symbolic it’s part of a broader effort to undermine Powell ahead of the 2025 reappointment decision. While this has no immediate impact on policy, the **optics of dissent**, combined with pressure from Trump-aligned governors, could shift market perception quickly if Powell’s forward guidance wavers.

Weaker-than-expected core capital goods orders and soft small-business surveys reaffirm that firms are pulling back investment. It’s not recessionary, but it is a material **drag on confidence in the soft landing thesis**. If July PCE or NFP data miss, the odds of a September cut could surge. But until then, the market isn’t willing to make a preemptive bet.

At –107.3 bp, the OIS curve is no longer building in more easing it's simply **preserving the current expectation set**. That’s a reflection of uncertainty, not confidence.

The market is betting:

*   Powell holds steady but nods to fall easing.
    
*   Trump’s tariff blitz is controlled, not chaotic.
    
*   Growth data cools but doesn’t crack.
    

That’s a fine balance, but **every leg of that stool is shakier than it was two weeks ago**.

The next 72 hours Powell’s tone, QRA duration bias, and the scale of tariff implementation could determine whether we stay pinned or reset materially wider.
