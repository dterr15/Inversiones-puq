_**The Macro Regime Tracker offers a daily lens on how shifts in growth, inflation, and liquidity affect short-term risk and reward. Leveraging machine learning, AI, and cross-asset data, it identifies macro changes and their impact on market positioning.**_

I have laid out the full picture for the macro regime, risk assets, and interest rates here:

The connected video is here:

We are seeing risk assets, specifically Bitcoin, move in lockstep with the neutral stance to risk assets I laid out earlier in the week:

The entire question is WHEN will a bottom occur that allows for being bullish (either a DCA for long-term holders or a leverage trade for active traders). For now, I remain neutral.

_**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_

Markets unraveled sharply Friday, with the S&P 500 shedding **0.56%**, marking its worst session since May. Beneath the surface, the damage was more telling: every major sector bar Health Care and Utilities closed in the red, volatility spiked, and short-end yields plunged in the biggest daily move since 2023.

This wasn’t just a tactical pullback it was a macro reset. A softer-than-expected payrolls print, large downward revisions to prior months, and rising unemployment triggered a wholesale rethink of the labor market narrative. Toss in Trump’s escalating pressure campaign on the Fed, a political sacking at the BLS, and the surprise resignation of Fed Governor Kugler, and markets were left spinning.

_(Weighted Return Contribution to S&P 500)_

**Top Positive Contributors:**

*   **Health Care (+0.05 pp)** — The only sector offering real ballast, thanks to pharma and services. Possibly a defensive rotation bid, or early speculation around Medicare expansion for weight-loss coverage.
    
*   **Utilities (+0.01 pp)** — Modest but consistent. Yield proxies saw demand even as the curve bull steepened sharply.
    

**Top Negative Contributors:**

*   **Info Tech (–0.35 pp)** — Megacaps finally cracked. Amazon’s guidance miss wiped out recent resilience, and even the AI story took a breather.
    
*   **Financials (–0.13 pp)** — Hit hard by the curve. With 2s down nearly 30 bps and easing expectations surging, the macro backdrop turned sharply bearish for banks.
    
*   **Comm Services (–0.08 pp)** — Meta held up reasonably well, but the rest of the space sagged with Tech.
    
*   **Consumer Discretionary (–0.07 pp)** — High-beta retailers and autos buckled under macro weight.
    
*   **Energy (–0.05 pp)** — WTI’s retracement and geopolitical jitters spooked flows.
    
*   **Staples, Industrials, Real Estate, Materials** — Minor drags across the board as broad de-risking took hold.
    

_(Unweighted Daily Returns)_

**Leaders:**

*   **Health Care (+0.55%)** — A rare bright spot amid the carnage. Driven by both fundamental rotation and a potential policy tailwind.
    
*   **Utilities (+0.28%)** — Quiet resilience despite volatility spike and bond rally possibly flow-driven into low-beta havens.
    

**Laggards:**

*   **Energy (–1.69%)** — Crude weakness and copper’s ongoing slump weighed. Tariff fear renewed pressure.
    
*   **Real Estate (–1.25%)** — Duration whiplash hit hard. A classic beta unwind on a macro curve move.
    
*   **Info Tech (–1.03%)** — The biggest weight on the index. Amazon’s stumble marked a broader shift in sentiment.
    
*   **Financials (–0.92%)** — Flattening repriced bank earnings outlook in real time.
    
*   **Comm Services (–0.86%)** — Choppy internals, but overall weak.
    
*   **Consumer Discretionary (–0.70%)**, **Staples (–0.38%)**, **Industrials (–0.16%)**, **Materials (–0.20%)** — Weakness across cyclical and defensive sectors alike. The tape had nowhere to hide.
    

Friday’s jobs report was a game-changer.

Headline payrolls came in at just **+73K**, nearly **30K below consensus**, while the prior two months were revised lower by a staggering **–258K**. Unemployment ticked up to **4.2%**, and average job growth over the past three months now sits below **35K** a steep slide from earlier in the year.

The labor market long the last line of defense for hawks is showing cracks. Markets responded in force: **2-year yields collapsed 28 bps to 3.68%**, the **VIX jumped above 20**, and traders moved to price in nearly two full cuts by year-end, with **September odds rising to 90%**.

Trump, never one to let a narrative go to waste, fired the **BLS Commissioner** within hours of the release and renewed calls for **Fed Chair Powell to step aside**. Meanwhile, **Fed Governor Kugler resigned**, handing Trump another opportunity to reshape the Fed board. This all comes amid a wave of revised inflation data, collapsing response rates at the BLS, and rising skepticism about data integrity especially in light of political interference.

Friday’s session was less about valuation and more about **narrative collapse**. A softening labor market, rising political pressure on the Fed, and the erosion of confidence in economic institutions have sparked a genuine repricing not just of rates, but of leadership, breadth, and macro trajectory.

The S&P 500 is once again leaning heavily on narrow tech leadership, but even that crumbled under the weight of Amazon’s miss and a more cautious AI tone. Breadth is deteriorating, macro risk premia are expanding, and the once-durable soft-landing thesis is beginning to fray.

**Current IG Spread: 53.94 bp | 5-Year Avg: 62.70 bp | COVID High: 151.80 bp | Cycle Low: 43.75 bp**

Investment-grade credit spreads widened modestly on Friday, closing at **53.94 bp**, still within their historically tight range but now inching higher after an extended period of remarkable stability. While far from a disorderly repricing, the tone has shifted: macro volatility is back, politics are bleeding into policy, and the “durable carry” thesis is starting to wobble under the weight of accumulating uncertainty.

*   **< 60 bp**: Duration-friendly, carry-positive zone for insurers, pensions, and liability-driven buyers.
    
*   **60–70 bp**: Macro noise threshold, where volatility or inflation threats prompt positioning cuts.
    
*   **\> 90 bp**: Systemic stress unlikely unless global macro or geopolitical shocks return.
    

**Jobs Data Breaks the Spell**

July’s jobs report was the weakest in over three years, with just **+73K payrolls added**, and a two-month revision **cutting 258K**. Unemployment ticked up to **4.2%**, and average job gains have collapsed to just **35K** over the past quarter.

That’s a sharp shift from the “Teflon labor market” narrative and it’s exactly the kind of fundamental deterioration that begins to matter for credit, particularly when paired with rising policy risk.

**Trump’s BLS Purge and Fed Pressure**

Within hours of the jobs release, **Trump fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics**, publicly questioning the integrity of US labor data. Simultaneously, **Fed Governor Kugler resigned**, opening the door for a more dovish Trump-aligned replacement just as the Fed faces rising dissent from within.

This isn’t just headline risk. It raises questions about **institutional credibility** and the **Fed’s ability to maintain independence**, both of which are vital pillars of market confidence especially in credit markets that thrive on stability.

Spreads below 55 bp are not a problem but they are a **statement of confidence**. Confidence in Fed stability, in economic durability, in earnings resilience, and in political restraint. All of which are now, arguably, under pressure.

We're not in crisis territory. But we are in a **transition phase** and credit markets, always the last to panic but also the slowest to react, are now in a spot where even small macro tremors could have a disproportionate impact.

With Powell's grip loosening, Trump reshaping the board, and economic data showing signs of real stress

See the intro published for how to use the Mag7 models here: [Link](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/mag7-models-positioning-and-macro)

**Cumulative Implied Easing (to Jan 2027): –139.0 bp  
Terminal Rate (Jan 2027): 2.940%  
September OIS Cut Probability: 91.6% | Implied Rate: 4.101%**

The market has moved. Decisively. A week after Powell stood pat and tried to push back on near-term easing bets, Friday’s labor data shattered the illusion of a durable jobs market and forced traders to recalibrate. The implied path now prices **more than 5.5 cuts** by January 2027, with a **September cut nearly a done deal**.

Front-end risk has gone from drift to drop. And not because of panic because of hard data.

**Labor Market Shows Cracks**

July payrolls rose just **+73K**, while prior months were revised lower by **–258K**. Unemployment rose to **4.2%**, and the 3-month average of job gains has plunged to **35K** the weakest since the post-pandemic reopening period.

This isn’t “softening at the margin.” It’s a **trend break**. And it's happening just as internal Fed dissent grows louder and Trump intensifies his campaign to shake up the board.

**Kugler’s Resignation and Political Risk Surge**

Fed Governor **Adriana Kugler’s resignation** opens the door for a Trump-aligned pick, further complicating the Fed’s ability to project independence. Powell is now isolated, caught between a weakening macro backdrop and intensifying political heat.

**Trump fired the BLS Commissioner**, questioned the data’s integrity, and called on the board to “take control.” Markets may be pricing in more cuts but they’re also beginning to price **institutional fragility**.

Just one week ago, traders assumed the Fed would **wait until the data forced its hand**. That moment may already be here.

*   The **front end is pricing urgency** (91.6% chance in September).
    
*   The **mid-curve is extending the easing** (five cuts by Oct 2026).
    
*   The **terminal rate has collapsed** to 2.94% the lowest since before Powell’s June hawkish pivot.
    

This isn’t about positioning or sentiment. This is about data. And the data no longer supports holding.

The market is no longer giving Powell the benefit of the doubt. It's giving him a schedule.

Tariffs, political risk, labor softness… the glue that held the "resilient expansion" story together is coming undone.
