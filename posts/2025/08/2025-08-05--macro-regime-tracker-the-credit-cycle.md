_**The Macro Regime Tracker offers a daily lens on how shifts in growth, inflation, and liquidity affect short-term risk and reward. Leveraging machine learning, AI, and cross-asset data, it identifies macro changes and their impact on market positioning.**_

I did a video breakdown of all my macro views for equities, bonds, and Bitcoin here:

_**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_

The S&P 500 fell another 0.52% on Tuesday, extending its recent slide as macro cracks widened and market leadership faltered. Beneath the surface, the story was clear: **Tech, Utilities, and Comm Services led the decline**, while cyclicals showed scattered resilience.

The backdrop? A **weaker-than-expected ISM Services print**, fresh signs of **sticky inflation**, and escalating **tariff risks** as Trump’s new trade regime approaches implementation. With market breadth thinning and macro fragilities resurfacing, risk appetite is becoming increasingly selective.

(**Weighted Return Contribution to S&P 500**)

**Top Negative Contributors**

*   **Info Tech (–0.31 pp)** – Once the market’s cornerstone, Tech cracked again under the weight of tariff fears and guidance disappointments from the likes of AMD and Super Micro. Chip-related headlines and AI profit-taking accelerated the unwind.
    
*   **Comm Services (–0.10 pp)** – Weakness was broad, and AI hype faded for now. Media and streaming names underperformed.
    
*   **Financials (–0.09 pp)** – Rates were mixed, but the curve and credit tightening remain macro headwinds.
    
*   **Utilities (–0.03 pp)** – Surprising downside as yield proxies failed to catch a bid despite stable long-end yields.
    

**Flat to Minor Positives**

*   **Energy (0.00 pp)** – Stable despite WTI softness, likely aided by positioning.
    
*   **Materials, Real Estate, Discretionary (each +0.01 pp)** – A few green shoots, but not enough to offset broader losses.
    
*   **Staples, Industrials, Health Care** – Slight negative-to-flat contributors.
    

(**Unweighted Daily Returns**)

**Leaders**

*   **Materials (+0.31%)** – Rotation into commodity plays as traders eyed tariff beneficiaries.
    
*   **Real Estate (+0.26%)** – A rebound despite flat duration. Likely short-covering or mean reversion after recent pain.
    
*   **Discretionary (+0.09%)** – A rare bounce in retailers and autos helped buck the trend.
    

**Laggards**

*   **Utilities (–1.13%)** – Surprising laggard as flows avoided defensives. A sign of risk-off without the typical rotation.
    
*   **Comm Services (–0.98%)** – Meta and peers pulled back alongside broader AI names.
    
*   **Info Tech (–0.92%)** – The largest drag. Chips, cloud, and hyperscalers came under pressure amid rising China export risks.
    
*   **Financials (–0.65%)** – The bid in front-end rates failed to lift bank sentiment.
    
*   **Staples (–0.15%)**, **Industrials (–0.03%)**, **Health Care (–0.13%)**, **Energy (+0.03%)** – All posted muted or modest losses.
    

The **ISM Services Index dropped to 50.1**, a hair’s breadth above contraction and the weakest reading since early 2023. The **employment gauge sank to 46.4**, its fourth contraction in five months, pointing to a clear hiring slowdown not layoffs, but stalled expansion. Simultaneously, the **prices-paid component surged** to the highest since October 2022 an inflation red flag.

This “stagflation-lite” setup complicates the Fed’s path. Markets still price in **a 90% chance of a September cut**, but sticky inflation and political interference muddy the waters. Trump’s tariff agenda is rolling forward **semiconductors and pharma imports are next**, and the **average tariff rate could rise to 15.2%** by week’s end. Services firms are already reporting **delayed purchases, margin compression, and uncertainty**.

Meanwhile, Trump continues to ratchet up political pressure. He’s hinted at replacing Powell, threatened financial institutions, and accused major banks of bias. Even **Fed hiring decisions are now political fodder**. Kugler’s recent resignation only heightens the stakes.

Markets aren’t just battling valuation concerns they’re navigating a fog of **policy instability, inflation confusion, and global trade fragmentation**. With breadth narrowing again and mega-cap tech wobbling, even the AI trade is feeling vulnerable.

This is less a panic than a **slow burn of uncertainty**. Macro tailwinds are losing force. Positioning is tight. And while the Fed may still cut, it will be doing so into a far murkier policy environment than just a month ago.

**Current IG Spread:** 52.52 bp  
**5-Year Avg:** 62.69 bp  
**COVID High:** 151.80 bp  
**Cycle Low:** 43.75 bp

Investment-grade credit markets remain steady on the surface, but the foundation is beginning to rumble. Spreads tightened modestly to 52.52 bp still well below average, yet increasingly at odds with a macro narrative that has turned messy, inflationary, and politically volatile.

*   **< 60 bp**: Duration-friendly, carry-positive zone for insurers, pensions, and liability-driven buyers.
    
*   **60–70 bp**: Macro noise threshold, where volatility or inflation threats prompt positioning cuts.
    
*   **\> 90 bp**: Systemic stress unlikely unless global macro or geopolitical shocks return.
    

**ISM’s services index fell to 50.1**, scraping the edge of contraction, with **employment tumbling to 46.4** its fourth drop in five months. The **prices-paid component surged to a post-2022 high**, painting a worrying picture: inflation is sticky, demand is cooling, and hiring is stalling. That’s not a soft landing; that’s a slow stall.

Add in **Trump’s fresh 15.2% average tariff regime** with reciprocal duties on semis, pharma, critical minerals, and threats toward India and it’s clear: credit markets are brushing off a materially noisier backdrop.

While equities are chopping and yields drifting, credit seems to be stuck in “autopilot premium compression” and that’s starting to feel dangerously complacent.

Credit markets are the last to flinch and sometimes that’s a virtue. But sometimes it’s just inertia. The **risk-reward** in IG at these levels is no longer obvious. In fact, it may be asymmetric… **to the downside**.

A 52 bp spread with a Fed board in flux, tariffs rolling out, and services stagnating? That’s not “too tight to touch,” but it is “too tight to ignore.”

See the intro published for how to use the Mag7 models here: [Link](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/mag7-models-positioning-and-macro)

**Cumulative Implied Easing (to Jan 2027): –133.5 bp**  
**Terminal Rate (Jan 2027): 2.995%**  
**September OIS Cut Probability: 91.6% | Implied Rate: 4.101%**

The path of policy normalization remains aggressively priced, but Tuesday’s modest repricing reflects a market in pause mode **not retreat**. The probability of a **September cut holds near certainty at 91.6%**, but the **total easing priced through January 2027 narrowed to –133.5 bp**, down from –139.0 bp at the end of last week.

This isn’t about renewed confidence. It’s about short-term recalibration amid **political noise, sticky inflation signals, and mounting policy uncertainty**.

The **services sector is barely expanding**, with ISM’s headline index falling to 50.1 and the employment gauge contracting sharply to 46.4. Yet **inflation remains sticky**, with prices-paid hitting the highest since October 2022. This stagflation-lite setup complicates the Fed’s messaging especially with Trump’s pressure campaign intensifying.

*   **Tariff risks** are escalating: semiconductor and pharma duties are expected within days, and the **average tariff rate will hit 15.2%**, up from just 2.3% before Trump took office.
    
*   **Fed Chair Powell’s grip continues to loosen**, with fresh speculation about replacements, as political rhetoric swells.
    
*   **Data quality is now under scrutiny**, following the abrupt removal of the BLS commissioner and public accusations about labor market manipulation.
    

Despite the slight move in rates pricing, the message from markets hasn’t changed:

*   **September is priced in.**
    
*   **A full five cuts are still implied through mid-2026.**
    
*   **The terminal rate has cracked below 3%.**
    

The **disinflation narrative is colliding with labor softening and a confidence hit to institutions**. That’s not a clean-cut easing cycle, it’s a regime shift.

With inflation stickier than expected and growth visibly weakening, the Fed is being squeezed from both sides. Normally, that would mean caution. But this isn’t a normal cycle it’s increasingly **a political one**, and markets know it.
