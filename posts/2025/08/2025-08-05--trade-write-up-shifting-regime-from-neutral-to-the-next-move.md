I have been laying out the tensions for equities and bonds in the following pieces:

*   [Comprehensive Macro Report: Navigating the Uncertainty Trifecta](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/comprehensive-macro-report-navigating)
    
*   **[Comprehensive Macro Report: Video Breakdown of Equities, Bonds, and Bitcoin](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/comprehensive-macro-report-video)**
    
*   **[Trade Write Up: The Macro Trade](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/trade-write-up-the-macro-trade)**
    
*   **[Alpha Report: Equity Breadth, Dispersion, and The Risk Curve](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/alpha-report-equity-breadth-dispersion)**
    

As I explained in the Alpha Report yesterday, equities are going to get a lot more difficult over the next month since breadth is normalizing. I turned neutral equities on FOMC day because of some warning signs and we have seen a marginal drawdown that is beginning to create oppurtunity. However, the expression of trade is critical here.
