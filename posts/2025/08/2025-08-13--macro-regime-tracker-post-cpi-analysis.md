_**The Macro Regime Tracker offers a daily lens on how shifts in growth, inflation, and liquidity affect short-term risk and reward. Leveraging machine learning, AI, and cross-asset data, it identifies macro changes and their impact on market positioning.**_

The CPI print today showed inflation coming in ABOVE expectations and the market is beginning to converge to the view I have been laying out. The main idea is that inflation is NOT just tariff driven but actually a fuction of growth. This is why core services accelerated in the print today.

I covered this and Q&A in the live stream today. The recording can be found here:

Bottom line, we remain in the same regime where stocks and Bitcoin are skewed to the upside and bonds face headwinds. We saw yields in Germany make new highs today, which is the first warning shot about the global nature of the duration risk we are seeing.

_**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_

The S&P 500 rose **0.68%** on Tuesday, closing at a fresh record alongside the Nasdaq 100 as an in-line July CPI print bolstered expectations the Federal Reserve will cut rates in September. While services inflation accelerated, goods prices especially tariff-exposed categories came in softer than feared, easing concerns of a broader inflation flare-up.

Money markets now price in nearly a **90% probability** of a September cut, with some traders openly debating the potential for a **50 bp move**. Two-year Treasury yields fell 4 bps to 3.73% before paring gains, and the dollar weakened 0.4%.

_(Weighted Return Contribution to S&P 500)_

**Top Contributors**

*   **Info Tech (+0.31 pp)** – Mega-cap tech extended its leadership, with semis and cloud names outperforming.
    
*   **Comm Services (+0.10 pp)** – Gains in media and streaming drove the sector higher.
    
*   **Financials (+0.10 pp)** – Banks benefited from curve steepening optimism as rate-cut odds rose.
    

**Moderate Contributors**

*   Health Care (+0.05 pp) – Outperformed on a mix of managed care strength and biotech rebounds.
    
*   Industrials (+0.06 pp) – Transport and aerospace names firmed on cyclical sentiment.
    

**Smaller Contributions**

*   Consumer Discretionary (+0.02 pp), Materials (+0.02 pp), Energy (+0.01 pp), Utilities (+0.01 pp) – All positive, though gains were incremental.
    
*   Real Estate (0.00 pp), Consumer Staples (0.00 pp) – Largely flat.
    

_(Unweighted Daily Returns)_

**Leaders**

*   **Comm Services (+1.02%)** – Led by internet platforms and ad-tech.
    
*   **Materials (+0.93%)** – Metals and chemicals rallied on China stimulus chatter.
    
*   **Info Tech (+0.90%)** – Broad-based strength, semiconductors outperforming.
    
*   **Financials (+0.75%)**, **Industrials (+0.73%)**, **Health Care (+0.61%)** – Cyclicals and defensives alike joined the advance.
    

**Laggards**

*   Energy (+0.36%) – Oil names lagged despite crude stability.
    
*   Consumer Staples (+0.07%), Real Estate (+0.07%), Utilities (+0.22%) – Defensive sectors rose modestly.
    

**Inflation Data** – Core CPI rose **0.3% MoM**, the strongest since January, driven by services (airfares, medical care, recreation), while goods inflation stayed subdued. Tariff-sensitive categories like toys, furnishings, and sporting goods saw only mild price gains. YoY core CPI printed at 3.1%, just above expectations.

**Fed Policy Shift** – The print reinforced market conviction in a September cut. Treasury Secretary **Scott Bessent** floated the idea of a **50 bp reduction**, while Richmond Fed’s **Tom Barkin** kept an open stance pending more data. Kansas City Fed’s **Jeff Schmid** struck a more cautious note, preferring to hold rates unless demand weakens materially.

**Tariff & Fiscal Dynamics** – July tariff revenue hit a **record $28B**, up 273% YoY, yet the budget deficit widened to $291B. Bessent hinted full-year tariff revenues could exceed **1% of GDP**, even as fiscal deficits remain on a worsening trajectory post-tax cuts.

Tuesday’s CPI release removed one major risk from the near-term outlook, tariffs have yet to feed meaningfully into broad inflation. The market’s rally reflects confidence that the Fed will prioritize labor market softness over the recent services inflation uptick. The next pivot point is Friday’s **retail sales report**, which will determine whether consumption resilience reinforces the case for a gentler easing pace or emboldens those pushing for an aggressive half-point cut in September.

**IG OAS:** **50.10 bp** • **5-yr avg:** 62.67 bp • **Cycle low:** 43.75 bp • **COVID high:** 151.80 bp  
**10y UST:** softer post-print • **Equity tape:** risk-on, new highs • **Dollar:** lower

Investment-grade spreads ticked **~1 bp tighter to ~50 bp**, back near the floor of the post-COVID range as July CPI landed **in line** (core **+0.3% m/m**). Services inflation re-accelerated but **goods/tariff-exposed categories stayed tame**, reinforcing the consensus that the **first move is in rates, not credit risk**. Money markets hold **~90% odds of a September cut**, and Treasury Secretary **Bessent** even floated **50 bp**; Fed speakers split (Barkin open-minded, Schmid cautious), but none of it changed the **carry-comfort** tone in IG.

*   **< 60 bp**: Duration-friendly, carry-positive zone for insurers, pensions, and liability-driven buyers.
    
*   **60–70 bp**: Macro noise threshold, where volatility or inflation threats prompt positioning cuts.
    
*   **\> 90 bp**: Systemic stress unlikely unless global macro or geopolitical shocks return.
    

*   **Inflation/Cuts:** CPI keeps a **September cut** in play; the **debate shifts to 25 vs 50 bp**. For IG, **front-end rate relief** > credit shock: lower all-in yields extend demand from total-return and yield targets.
    
*   **Tariffs/Fiscal:** **Record monthly tariff receipts** lift near-term revenues but don’t close the **widening budget gap** duration, not spread, is where fiscal risk bites first (long-end term premium).
    
*   **Labor:** Softer payroll backdrop argues the Fed **skews to employment**, another reason spreads hug the floor barring a growth air-pocket.
    

IG remains **priced for “good-enough” macro** and an easing Fed. Unless upcoming growth data surprise on the hot side, the path of least resistance is **carry and roll** with **OAS anchored ~50–55 bp**. The next meaningful spread catalyst is **not** CPI it’s whether consumption blinks or the Fed blinks **bigger** in September.

See the intro published for how to use the Mag7 models here: [Link](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/mag7-models-positioning-and-macro)

**Cumulative Implied Easing (to Jan 2027): –131.3 bp**  
**Terminal Rate (Jan 2027): 3.017%**  
**September OIS Cut Probability: 96.8% | Implied Rate: 4.088%**

Markets pushed the easing path a touch lower after an in-line CPI: the **September cut is essentially priced**, with **~24 bp** of reduction implied on the day and **~97% odds** of at least 25 bp. Beyond September, the curve added a few basis points of easing, taking the **terminal to ~3.02%** and total cuts to **–131 bp** by **Jan ’27**.

*   **Inflation:** Core CPI **+0.3% m/m** (strongest since January) but **goods inflation stayed subdued**, muting fears of broad tariff pass-through.
    
*   **Policy rhetoric:** Treasury Sec. **Bessent** floated the option of **50 bp** in September; Fed’s **Barkin** stayed flexible while **Schmid** leaned toward holding unless demand weakens. Odds for **a September move ~90%** in money markets remain intact, with debate shifting to **25 vs. 50**.
    
*   **Macro tape:** Equities at new highs, **2-yr ~3.73%** (softer), dollar lower—conditions that keep front-end easing bias in place.
    

The market just nudged the glidepath lower: **September is done in all but name**, and the **terminal slides to ~3.02%**. Next catalysts—**Retail Sales, PPI→PCE inputs, and Fed speak**—will decide whether we debate **how much** in September, not **if**.
