_**The Macro Regime Tracker offers a daily lens on how shifts in growth, inflation, and liquidity affect short-term risk and reward. Leveraging machine learning, AI, and cross-asset data, it identifies macro changes and their impact on market positioning.**_

We saw the PPI print come in above expectations today, which falls directly in line with the views I have been laying out.

MAIN IDEA: INFLATION RISK IS GREATER THAN RECESSION RISK.

I recorded a livestream today that explains this dynamic further:

We saw bonds down on the day as equities exhibited some selling pressure. ES and NQ mean-reverted back up into the close as the Russell and Bitcoin ended the day in the red. If you are trying to understand more about how positioning functions through catalysts like this, I would encourage you to review all the Macro Alpha Primers here:

My view is equities remain skewed to the upside. Bitcoin and the Russell outperformed ES earlier this week, so an underperformance today is not surprising. I laid out the logic and levels for ES at the end of this report for paid subscribers, if you want to review it:

Bitcoin underperformed ES and expanded its short-term range within the hourly timeframe. If Bitcoin has a significant move up OR down relative to the timeframe we are looking at, you need to expect a commensurate period of time to take place before mean reversion. In other words, if I have a view on the specific driver of the selling pressure is going to mean-revert immediately, then I could have bought the low today (I didn’t). However, since it is deviating from ES in its underperformance, I would want to wait until I see it begin outperforming ES AND allow time for consolidation to occur. The underlying principle here is that time and price go hand in hand. Connect information with this, and you can have an edge in markets.

If none of that makes sense, I believe Bitcoin will move higher from here and stay above 115k. If it doesn’t, this could be a sign of further selling pressure depending on some other factors as well.

_**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_

The S&P 500 rose **0.37%**, but the tape was narrow: yields climbed after a hotter PPI, trimming the odds of a larger September cut while leaving a quarter-point move as the base case. The dollar firmed; crude gained; gold slipped. Two-year Treasuries **+6 bps to 3.73%**, tens **+5 bps to 4.29%** as traders marked down 50 bp talk and penciled in a more “less dovish” path.

_(Weighted return contribution to S&P 500)_

*   **Info Tech** **(+0.13 pp)** — mega-caps steadied; chip headlines (Intel/NVIDIA) helped.
    
*   **Financials** **(+0.09 pp)** — higher long rates and firmer curve optics aided banks.
    
*   **Health Care** **(+0.06 pp)** — broad advance across pharma/managed care.
    
*   **Communication Services** **(+0.06 pp)** — platforms and media firmed.
    
*   **Consumer Discretionary** **(+0.05 pp)** — travel/auto strength.
    
*   **Energy** **(+0.01 pp)** — crude bounce provided a tailwind.
    
*   **Drags:** **Consumer Staples (–0.03 pp)**, **Industrials (–0.03 pp)**, **Utilities (–0.01 pp)**; **Materials/Real Estate ~0.00 pp**.
    

_(Unweighted daily returns)_

*   **Leaders:** Health Care **(+0.71%)**, Financials **(+0.63%)**, Communication Services **(+0.59%)**, Consumer Discretionary **(+0.49%)**, Info Tech **(+0.39%)**, Energy **(+0.25%)**.
    
*   **Laggards:** Consumer Staples **(–0.60%)**, Utilities **(–0.34%)**, Industrials **(–0.32%)**, Materials **(–0.17%)**, Real Estate **(–0.04%)**.
    

*   **Wholesale inflation:** **PPI +0.9% m/m, +3.3% y/y**—strongest monthly gain in three years; services **+1.1%**. Tariff pass-through risk moved up the agenda.
    
*   **Policy expectations:** Markets still lean to a **September 25 bp cut** (odds ~mid-80s) while **50 bp** looks **off the table** absent a growth shock.
    
*   **Fedspeak:** **Bessent** clarified his “neutral ~150 bp lower” comment (not prescribing cuts); **Musalem** says it’s too early and a 50 bp move isn’t warranted; **Barkin** sees a “stronger July” on the consumer side.
    
*   **Cross-asset:** Dollar firm; **WTI ~+$2.2% to $64**; **gold –0.5%**.
    

Breadth was soft versus the cap-weighted print classic late-day index resilience driven by Tech/Financials/Health Care while defensives bled on higher yields. With PPI re-heating and retail sales/consumer sentiment up next, the base case remains a **September 25 bp cut with a hawkish tone**. Into that setup, favor **quality growth with pricing power** and **rate-beta pockets** (banks) while fading **defensive duration proxies** (Staples/Utilities) on yield pops.

**IG OAS:** **49.96 bp** • **5-yr avg:** 62.65 bp • **Cycle low:** 43.75 bp • **COVID high:** 151.80 bp  
**Rates:** 2y **+6 bp to 3.73%** • 10y **+5 bp to 4.29%** • Dollar firmer • Equities mixed

Investment-grade spreads were essentially unchanged to **+0.24 bp** on the day at **~50 bp**, weathering a hotter **PPI (+0.9% m/m, +3.3% y/y; services +1.1%)** that pushed Treasury yields higher and clipped the market’s appetite for a larger September cut. Credit beta stayed calm: IG remains **~6 bp off cycle tights** and **~13 bp inside** its 5-year average, keeping the carry/richness debate front and center.

*   **< 60 bp**: Duration-friendly, carry-positive zone for insurers, pensions, and liability-driven buyers.
    
*   **60–70 bp**: Macro noise threshold, where volatility or inflation threats prompt positioning cuts.
    
*   **\> 90 bp**: Systemic stress unlikely unless global macro or geopolitical shocks return.
    

**Policy:** Markets lean to a **September 25 bp cut** with a “**less dovish**” tone; odds of 50 bp have faded after the PPI surprise. **Bessent** clarified he’s citing neutral-rate models (~150 bp lower) rather than prescribing cuts; **Musalem** says a 50 bp move isn’t warranted; **Barkin** smells a **firmer July consumer**—Friday retail sales is the next test.

**Rates & FX:** The **rates pop** (2s/10s +6/+5 bp) dented total-return math but didn’t shake spread risk; a **firmer dollar** and stronger oil are noise for IG fundamentals near term.

**Inflation & Earnings:** Wholesale-price re-acceleration raises **tariff pass-through risk** into margins later this year, but with CPI still contained, the base case is **gradual disinflation + modest easing**, a mix that typically anchors IG OAS in the **45–60 bp** channel.

Rates did the heavy lifting; credit didn’t blink. Until growth or policy surprises force a repricing, **carry over convexity** remains the IG playbook with spreads **anchored around 50 bp** and risks skewed to **rates, not OAS**.

See the intro published for how to use the Mag7 models here: [Link](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/mag7-models-positioning-and-macro)

**Cumulative Implied Easing (to Jan 2027): –131.0 bp**  
**Terminal Rate (Jan 2027): 3.020%**  
**September OIS Cut Probability:** **92.4%** — _Implied Rate:_ **4.099%** | _Implied Move:_ **–23.1 bp** (~0.92×25)

The front end cheapened after the PPI surprise, nudging the path _shallower_ versus yesterday. Markets still price a September cut, but the opener looks more like a **“less dovish 25”** than a 50. The glidepath now extends to a ~3.02% terminal by early 2027 (from ~2.97% yesterday).

*   **Inflation pulse:** **PPI +0.9% m/m, +3.3% y/y** (services +1.1%) lifted **2y/10y yields +6/+5 bp**, firmed the dollar, and knocked back the 50 bp tail.
    
*   **Fedspeak:** **Bessent** clarified he’s citing neutral-rate models (~150 bp lower) rather than prescribing cuts; **Musalem** says 50 bp isn’t warranted; **Barkin** sees a stronger July consumer.
    
*   **Next catalysts:** **Retail Sales** and **consumer sentiment** strong prints would keep the Fed on a “less dovish” track; soft prints reopen discussion of a faster glide.
    

The debate has shifted from _“if”_ to _“how dovish”_ the start is. After PPI, pricing favors a **25 bp September cut** with a slower follow-through (2025 ~**–57 bp**, 1H26 ~**–46 bp**). Until growth weakens decisively, expect the market to hold the **3.0–3.1%** terminal and lean toward **shallower**, data-contingent easing.
