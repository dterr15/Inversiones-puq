_**The Macro Regime Tracker offers a daily lens on how shifts in growth, inflation, and liquidity affect short-term risk and reward. Leveraging machine learning, AI, and cross-asset data, it identifies macro changes and their impact on market positioning.**_

See all macro views laid out here for HOW the Fed’s policy error is impacting markets:

_**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_

The S&P 500 slipped 0.35% as mixed US data and Alaska-summit headlines kept risk appetite on a short leash. Retail sales showed a solid, broad-based advance (control group +0.5%), but University of Michigan sentiment fell for the first time since April and inflation expectations ticked higher. Longer-dated Treasuries underperformed and gold was little changed. Chips lagged on a weak guide from Applied Materials; UnitedHealth and select “platforms” helped cushion the drop. Jackson Hole now comes into view, with Daly reiterating a “gradual” path and two cuts this year as a reasonable baseline.

(Weighted contribution to S&P 500 daily return)

*   Financials (–0.17 pp) — banks/insurers led the decline as the long end backed up and risk tone softened.
    
*   Information Technology (–0.15 pp) — semis heavy post-guide; mega-caps mixed.
    
*   Consumer Discretionary (–0.07 pp) — discretionary weakness alongside sentiment wobble.
    
*   Industrials (–0.04 pp), Materials (–0.01 pp), Utilities (–0.01 pp) — cyclicals/defensive duration pockets slipped.
    
*   Energy (–0.00 pp) — essentially flat with crude softer.
    
*   Consumer Staples (0.00 pp) — neutral.
    
*   Communication Services (+0.05 pp) — platforms/media bid.
    
*   Health Care (+0.05 pp) — managed care strength; stock-specific support.
    
*   Real Estate (+0.01 pp) — modest offset.
    

(Unweighted daily returns)  
Leaders:

*   Health Care (+0.58%), Real Estate (+0.46%), Communication Services (+0.45%), Consumer Staples (+0.06%).
    

Laggards:

*   Financials (–1.28%), Consumer Discretionary (–0.71%), Industrials (–0.49%), Materials (–0.44%), Information Technology (–0.43%), Utilities (–0.32%), Energy (–0.15%).
    
*   S&P 500 (–0.35%).
    

*   Data: Retail sales beat on the control group and June was revised higher, but sentiment fell and inflation expectations rose; IP dipped (–0.1% m/m) and capacity use edged to 77.5%. The read-through is a still-resilient goods pulse against softer confidence and a hint of tariff-related pricing risk.
    
*   Policy path: Markets remain anchored on a 25 bp September cut with another move later this year; Daly called two cuts a “good projection” while pushing back on an outsized September step. Powell’s Jackson Hole speech is the next risk marker.
    
*   Geopolitics: The Trump–Putin Alaska meeting kept headline risk elevated (ceasefire talk, potential sanction/tariff paths). Chips/steel tariff chatter and the reported Chips Act/Intel discussions added to idiosyncratic sector swings.
    
*   Cross-asset: Bear-steepening bias (30s > 10s > 2s), softer dollar, oil down, gold steady.
    

Breadth weakened and leadership rotated: Financials and Tech did the damage; Health Care/Comm Services provided the ballast. With consumer “do vs. say” splitting (sales firm, sentiment softer) and Jackson Hole ahead, the base case remains a 25 bp September cut framed less dovishly.

IG OAS: **50.04 bp** • 5-yr avg: **62.65 bp** (≈**12.6 bp inside**) • Cycle low: **43.75 bp** (≈**6.3 bp off tights**) • COVID high: **151.80 bp**  
Rates: **2y 3.75% (+2 bp)** • **10y 4.32% (+3 bp)** • **30y 4.92% (+5 bp)** • Dollar –0.2% • WTI **$63.12 (–1.3%)** • Gold +0.1%

IG spreads finished essentially unchanged around the **50 bp** handle—calm in the face of a mild bear-steepening in Treasuries and headline risk around the Alaska summit. The level keeps IG squarely in the carry zone: ~**6 bp** off cycle tights and ~**13 bp** inside the 5-year average, with rates, not OAS doing the P&L lifting.

*   **< 60 bp**: Duration-friendly, carry-positive zone for insurers, pensions, and liability-driven buyers.
    
*   **60–70 bp**: Macro noise threshold, where volatility or inflation threats prompt positioning cuts.
    
*   **\> 90 bp**: Systemic stress unlikely unless global macro or geopolitical shocks return.
    

*   **Consumer mix:** July retail sales were solid (control group **+0.5%**) while **UMich sentiment slipped** and inflation expectations rose—“what they do” firm, “what they say” softer.
    
*   **Policy path:** Markets still lean to a **25 bp** cut in September with another move later this year; **Daly** called two cuts a “good projection,” toning down 50 bp chatter. **Jackson Hole** is the next risk marker for rates volatility rather than spread risk.
    
*   **Geopolitics/industry:** Alaska talks and sanction/tariff headlines (chips/steel) add idiosyncratic sector noise, but not a systemic credit impulse at current levels.
    

Key risks to a wider regime are a sharp long-end selloff, a meaningful tariff pass-through to margins, or a geopolitics shock; absent that, IG should grind around ~50 bp.

See the intro published for how to use the Mag7 models here: [Link](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/mag7-models-positioning-and-macro)

Cumulative Implied Easing (to Jan 2027): **–128.5 bp**  
Terminal Rate (Jan 2027): **3.045%**  
September OIS Cut Probability: **85.2%** — _Implied Rate:_ **4.117%** | _Implied Move:_ **–21.3 bp** (~0.85×25)

The front end held its “gradual opener” stance. Pricing still favors a 25 bp cut in September, but the overall glide has nudged a touch **shallower** versus yesterday: terminal sits a bit higher (~3.05% vs ~3.02%). Year-end 2025 embeds **~–55 bp** of easing (10-Dec-25 implied **3.872%**), with the curve penciling in a further **~–45 bp** through 1H26 (to ~–99 bp by 17-Jun-26) and **~–107 bp** by late July 2026, before grinding toward the **–128.5 bp** endpoint by Jan ’27.

Retail sales stayed firm (control group **+0.5%**), but sentiment slipped and inflation expectations ticked up—keeping the Fed biased to a **measured** start rather than a shock-and-awe cut. Daly reinforced a “two cuts this year” baseline and pushed back on a 50 bp opener. With Alaska headlines adding headline risk and long-end rates bear-steepening, Powell’s Jackson Hole remarks are the next volatility node more for **rates** than for the **path**.

Debate remains “**how dovish**,” not “if.” The market is comfortable with a **25 bp September** followed by a **step-down cadence** into 2026, holding terminal near **3.0–3.1%**. Until growth softens decisively or inflation re-heats, expect the front-end to oscillate around this track: **shallower, data-contingent easing**, with risks skewed to rates volatility rather than a wholesale repricing of cuts.
