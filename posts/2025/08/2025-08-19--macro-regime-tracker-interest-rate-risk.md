_**The Macro Regime Tracker offers a daily lens on how shifts in growth, inflation, and liquidity affect short-term risk and reward. Leveraging machine learning, AI, and cross-asset data, it identifies macro changes and their impact on market positioning.**_

_**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_

The S&P 500 eked out a +0.04% gain as traders squared up ahead of Jackson Hole and kept one eye on fast-moving diplomacy headlines around a potential Trump–Zelenskiy–Putin track. The 10-year Treasury yield rose 2 bp to ~4.34%, the Bloomberg dollar index added 0.2%, oil firmed, and gold was little changed. Pricing still leans toward a 25 bp September cut with roughly two moves penciled in by year-end, while Powell’s Friday speech is the week’s focal point.

(Weighted contribution to the S&P 500’s daily return; what actually drove the +0.04%)

*   Leaders: Consumer Discretionary (+0.05%), Industrials (+0.04%), Financials (+0.03%), Information Technology (+0.01%).
    
*   Laggards: Health Care (−0.04%), Real Estate (−0.02%), Communication Services (−0.02%), Utilities (−0.01%), Materials (−0.01%).
    
*   Flat pockets: Consumer Staples (0.00%), Energy (−0.00%).
    
*   Index: S&P 500 (+0.04%).
    

(Unweighted sector moves; where breadth sat)

*   Leaders: Industrials (+0.46%), Consumer Discretionary (+0.43%), Financials (+0.26%), Consumer Staples (+0.05%), Information Technology (+0.03%).
    
*   Laggards: Real Estate (−1.00%), Utilities (−0.55%), Materials (−0.51%), Health Care (−0.40%), Communication Services (−0.22%), Energy (−0.03%).
    
*   S&P 500: (+0.04%).
    

*   Policy watch: Powell’s Jackson Hole remarks are expected to frame the near-term path debate has shifted from “if” to “how much/how fast.” Swaps imply ~80% odds of a 25 bp September cut and two total by year-end.
    
*   Data pulse: Consumer sentiment softened and inflation expectations ticked up, highlighting a “do vs. say” split (retail sales still firm) and leaving markets sensitive to any hint that labor-market risk is overtaking inflation in the Fed’s calculus.
    
*   Geopolitics: The White House meetings with European leaders and President Zelenskiy, alongside chatter of potential trilateral talks with Russia, kept headline risk elevated but didn’t materially sway risk premia today.
    
*   Cross-asset: Mild bear-steepening (long end underperforms), dollar a touch stronger, oil up, gold steady.
    

Today’s tape was a classic pre-event drift: cyclicals (Industrials/Discretionary) did the lifting, defensives (REITs/Utilities/Health Care) faded, and the index netted a rounding-error gain.

IG OAS: **50.04 bp** • 5-yr avg **62.64 bp** (≈ **12.61 bp inside**) • Cycle low **43.75 bp** (≈ **6.29 bp off tights**) • COVID high **151.80 bp**  
Rates: **2y 3.77% (+2 bp)** • **10y 4.34% (+2 bp)** • **30y 4.94% (+2 bp)** • Dollar **+0.2%** • WTI **$63.34 (+0.9%)** • Gold **flat**

IG spreads were effectively unchanged around the 50-handle as the rates move was a small **parallel bear shift** rather than a re-steepener. Into Jackson Hole, credit beta stayed quiet while duration did the P&L work. At ~6 bp off cycle tights and ~13 bp inside the 5-year average, IG remains squarely in the **carry zone**.

*   **< 60 bp**: Duration-friendly, carry-positive zone for insurers, pensions, and liability-driven buyers.
    
*   **60–70 bp**: Macro noise threshold, where volatility or inflation threats prompt positioning cuts.
    
*   **\> 90 bp**: Systemic stress unlikely unless global macro or geopolitical shocks return.
    

*   **Policy:** Powell’s Jackson Hole remarks are the focal point. The debate has shifted from _if_ to _how much/how fast_; pricing leans to a **25 bp September cut** with roughly two moves by year-end.
    
*   **Data pulse:** Retail sales remain firm, but **UMich sentiment fell** and **inflation expectations ticked higher**—a classic “do vs. say” split that matters more for **rates** than for spreads at current carry-rich levels.
    
*   **Geopolitics:** Alaska diplomacy headlines (potential Trump–Zelenskiy–Putin track) kept headline risk elevated without a systemic credit impulse.
    

The path to a wider OAS regime likely runs through **rate volatility**: a sharp long-end selloff, a persistent dollar surge pressuring margins, or a meaningful tariff pass-through to input costs. Absent that, base case is **range-trading around ~50 bp** with carry doing the heavy lifting.

See the intro published for how to use the Mag7 models here: [Link](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/mag7-models-positioning-and-macro)

**Cumulative Implied Easing (to Jan 2027): –128.0 bp**  
**Terminal Rate (Jan 2027): 3.050%**  
**September OIS Cut Probability: 84.0% — Implied Rate 4.120% | Implied Move: –21.0 bp (~0.84×25)**

The front end remains locked on a **“cautious cut”** opener. Versus yesterday, the curve is essentially unchanged: a 25 bp September move is still the base case, the **terminal sits ~3.05%**, and the total path to Jan ’27 holds at **~–128 bp**.

*   **Event risk:** Powell’s Jackson Hole speech is the week’s fulcrum; debate has shifted from _if_ to _how much/how fast_. Swaps lean to **25 bp in September** with roughly **two cuts total** by year-end.
    
*   **Data pulse:** Retail sales remain firm, but **UMich sentiment fell** and **inflation expectations ticked up**—a mix that argues for a measured start rather than a shock-and-awe cut.
    
*   **Cross-asset tone:** 10-yr yields around **4.34%** with a mild bear bias; dollar a touch stronger; equities cautious into the event.
    

The market’s message hasn’t changed: a **gradual easing cycle** starting with **25 bp in September**, stepping down through 2026, and **terminal near 3.0–3.1%**. Near-term risk sits in **rates volatility** around Jackson Hole, not in a wholesale repricing of the cuts.
