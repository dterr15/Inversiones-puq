_**The Macro Regime Tracker offers a daily lens on how shifts in growth, inflation, and liquidity affect short-term risk and reward. Leveraging machine learning, AI, and cross-asset data, it identifies macro changes and their impact on market positioning.**_

I explained the equity setup in a video today here: (connected Twitter thread here: [LINK](https://x.com/Globalflows/status/1957863028050768187))

And the live stream from today:

We are seeing some marginal derisking of equities into Jackson Hole. I expect to remain above the CPI level in ES and then begin to make a short-term bottom to rally higher into Sept.

_**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_
