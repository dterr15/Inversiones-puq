_**The Macro Regime Tracker offers a daily lens on how shifts in growth, inflation, and liquidity affect short-term risk and reward. Leveraging machine learning, AI, and cross-asset data, it identifies macro changes and their impact on market positioning.**_

I recorded a livestream today explaining the setup for long-end rates from here:

And then recorded a video breaking down the forward curve as we move into Jackson Hole tomorrow:

As always, you can find all the updated systematic strategies and models below. I will be sending out some special updates in the next 24 hours, so keep an eye out for them!

_**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_

The S&P 500 finished essentially unchanged at +0.05% as traders trimmed September-cut odds into Jackson Hole on firmer PMIs and hawkish Fed chatter. Yields backed up, the dollar firmed, and leadership flipped toward Energy/Materials while classic defensives lagged.

What actually drove the +0.05% on the day:

**Offsets:** Energy (+0.02%), Information Technology (+0.02%), Financials (+0.01%), Materials (+0.01%), Consumer Discretionary (+0.01%), Communication Services (+0.01%), Consumer Staples (0.00%), Real Estate (0.00%).  
**Detractors:** Health Care (–0.02%), Utilities (–0.02%), Industrials (–0.01%).  
**Index:** S&P 500 (+0.05%).

**Leaders:** Energy (+0.82%), Materials (+0.64%), Real Estate (+0.20%), Communication Services (+0.08%), Information Technology (+0.06%), Consumer Discretionary (+0.05%), Financials (+0.04%), Consumer Staples (+0.02%).  
**Laggards:** Health Care (–0.20%), Industrials (–0.16%), Utilities (–0.66%).  
**Index:** S&P 500 (+0.05%).

*   **Data pulse:** US manufacturing PMI jumped to 53.3 (fastest since 2022), lifting the composite to this year’s high; services prices stayed hot. Claims rose but not enough to offset the growth signal.
    
*   **Policy tone:** Fed speakers leaned cautious Hammack wouldn’t support easing “if deciding tomorrow,” Bostic still sees one cut this year, Schmid called policy modestly restrictive. Markets trimmed September cut odds toward ~70% from >90% last week.
    
*   **Cross-asset tells:** Higher yields pressured rate-sensitives (Utilities, parts of Health Care) while cyclicals tied to real-activity (Energy/Materials) outperformed; USD firmer.
    

Positioning reset rather than trend change: a growth-positive, price-sticky mix pushed leadership to cyclicals and clipped defensives. Powell’s message on reaction function tomorrow is the fulcrum anything that downplays pre-commitment and stresses inflation risk keeps front-end sensitivity elevated and favors this “cyclicals > defensives” skew unless services inflation cools.

**IG OAS:** 51.59 bp • **5-yr avg** 62.60 bp (**~11.01 bp inside**) • **Cycle low** 43.75 bp (**~7.84 bp off tights**) • **COVID high** 151.80 bp (**~100.21 bp tighter**)

Spreads held the low-50s despite a rates backup—classic carry regime. Credit beta stayed orderly even as equities slipped and the dollar firmed.

*   **< 60 bp**: Duration-friendly, carry-positive zone for insurers, pensions, and liability-driven buyers.
    
*   **60–70 bp**: Macro noise threshold, where volatility or inflation threats prompt positioning cuts.
    
*   **\> 90 bp**: Systemic stress unlikely unless global macro or geopolitical shocks return.
    

*   **Growth pulse:** S&P Global mfg PMI jumped to **53.3** (fastest since 2022); composite at a YTD high. Pricing power remains sticky on tariffs/services.
    
*   **Fed tone:** Hammack wouldn’t back easing “if deciding tomorrow,” Bostic still at **one cut** this year, Schmid says policy is **moderately restrictive**. Goolsbee called the services-inflation pop “dangerous” but hopes it’s a blip. Odds of a **September cut ~70%** (down from >90% last week).
    
*   **Cross-asset:** **Treasury yields higher**, USD firmer; oil little changed. Equity weakness hasn’t bled into IG—another sign spreads are anchored by coupon/roll.
    

*   Powell’s reaction-function is the hinge. A message that re-emphasizes inflation risk and eschews pre-commitment likely **lifts rates vol first**; spreads follow only if it persists or equities wobble more materially. With OAS ~51–52, the **path of least resistance remains carry and modest roll**, bounded by fair-value talk in the mid-50s.
    

IG is trading as a **rates-sensitive carry asset** into Jackson Hole. If Powell leans hawkish, expect the first pain in duration (Treasury vol, curve beta); a **sustained move toward 55–60 bp** would likely require a combination of firmer services-price data and tighter financial conditions not just a one-day rates jump.

See the intro published for how to use the Mag7 models here: [Link](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/mag7-models-positioning-and-macro)

**Cumulative Implied Easing (to Jan 2027): –128.0 bp**  
**Terminal Rate (Jan 2027): 3.050% (~3.05%)**  
**September OIS Cut Probability: 75.6% — Implied Rate 4.141% | Implied Move: –18.9 bp (~0.76×25)**

The front end nudged **shallower** versus yesterday: the total path eases to **–128.0 bp** (from –130.5 bp) and the terminal **ticks up** +2½ bp. September remains a 25 bp base case but with softer odds (~76% vs low-80s). By **10-Dec-25** the curve embeds **–48.6 bp**, reaches **–95.7 bp** by **17-Jun-26**, and finishes **–128.0 bp** by **27-Jan-27**. Cadence still reads “step-downs through 1H26, then lighter trims into late-26/early-27.”

*   **Growth pulse:** Flash **manufacturing PMI 53.3** (fastest since 2022) lifts the composite to a YTD high; pricing power sticky on services/tariff pass-through.
    
*   **Fed tone:** Hammack wouldn’t back easing “if deciding tomorrow”; Bostic still at **one cut** this year; Goolsbee called the pop in services inflation “dangerous,” hoping it’s a blip. Odds of a September cut have slipped toward ~70s from >90% last week.
    
*   **Read-through:** Destination (total easing) barely changed; **pace** is the swing factor into Powell.
    

Same layout, a touch **shallower**: ~25 bp in September, ~two cuts by year-end, terminal around **3.05%**. Unless Powell leans hard against speed, the **carryable glide** remains intact; front-end P&L is about **pace rhetoric** more than the end-point.
