_**The Macro Regime Tracker offers a daily lens on how shifts in growth, inflation, and liquidity affect short-term risk and reward. Leveraging machine learning, AI, and cross-asset data, it identifies macro changes and their impact on market positioning.**_

We are coming off the price action from Jackson Hole, and I laid out the logic for HOW things are likely to develop here:

And recorded two videos today that can be found here:

And here:

A short note on Bitcoin: we are still seeing underperformance of Bitcoin relative to ES. Until this shifts or we move through a macro catalyst that causes a significant reversal, Bitcoin is going to have difficulty rallying. I believe we are still skewed to the upside based on the credit cycle, but we need to see a reconvergence with broad beta flows.

We continue to operate in a world of global liquidity where short term changes in cross boarder flows can impact Bitcoin. See the report on the structural liquidity dynamics here:

As always, all of the systematic models and strategies are below. As a reminder, I just launched all of the new interest rate sensitivity models, and you can find the launch video here. These will be free until Wednesday, and then they will be reserved for paid subscribers AFTER that.

I will be recording a video later tonight breaking things down more for you guys.

_**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_

Powell’s “door-is-open” cut message is yesterday’s news; today the market re-priced the pace of easing. Yields firmed (10y ~4.28%,) equities softened (S&P −0.23%), and breadth was weak (~400 S&P names lower). Traders still lean ~80% to a September cut and ~two by year-end, but the focus has shifted to how hawkish/dovish that first move will be ahead of core PCE (consensus: a tick higher y/y) and more Fed speak (Waller Thu; Logan flagged quarter-end money-market pressures even as QT headroom remains).

Offsets: Information Technology (+0.05%), Consumer Discretionary (+0.02%), Energy (+0.02%), Communication Services (+0.02%).  
Detractors: Health Care (−0.12%), Industrials (−0.08%), Consumer Staples (−0.06%), Financials (−0.06%), Utilities (−0.02%), Materials (−0.01%), Real Estate (−0.01%).  
Index: S&P 500 (−0.23%).

Leaders: Energy (+0.56%), Communication Services (+0.21%), Consumer Discretionary (+0.15%), Information Technology (+0.15%).  
Laggards: Health Care (−1.35%), Consumer Staples (−1.09%), Industrials (−0.95%), Utilities (−0.67%), Financials (−0.43%), Materials (−0.43%), Real Estate (−0.37%).  
Index: S&P 500 (−0.23%).

*   **Rates path vs growth**: The debate is now “dovish cut” vs “hawkish cut.” A firmer dollar and higher real yields weighed on defensives (Staples/HC/Utilities) while Energy outperformed with crude firmer.
    
*   **Positioning & leadership**: Mega-cap growth held up modestly (Tech/Comm Svcs small positives), but cyclicals outside Energy struggled as higher yields pinched Industrials/Financials.
    
*   **Event risk ahead**: Core PCE likely edges up; any upside surprise plus a stable labor print argues for a cautious, one-and-done September framing. Logan noted potential quarter-end funding pressure even as reserves remain ample—watch front-end funding and GC repo.
    

Powell’s pivot stays intact, but today’s tape says the market won’t pay up for defensives with yields backing up. Into PCE/Waller, base-case is a **September 25 bp “calibration” cut**, not an easing cycle endorsement.

**IG OAS:** 49.64 bp • **5-yr avg:** 62.61 bp (**~13 bp inside**) • **Cycle low:** 43.75 bp (**~5.9 bp off tights**) • **COVID high:** 151.80 bp (**~102 bp tighter**)

Spreads kept the “4-handle” even as the post-Powell sugar high cooled. Rates backed up modestly (10y ~4.28%, 2y ~3.73), the dollar firmed, equities softened, and breadth was poor yet IG beta stayed orderly and carry did the work. Money markets still lean ~80% to a September cut, but the debate has shifted to _how dovish vs hawkish_ that first trim will be. Logan flagged potential quarter-end funding pressure even as QT headroom remains.

*   **< 60 bp**: Duration-friendly, carry-positive zone for insurers, pensions, and liability-driven buyers.
    
*   **60–70 bp**: Macro noise threshold, where volatility or inflation threats prompt positioning cuts.
    
*   **\> 90 bp**: Systemic stress unlikely unless global macro or geopolitical shocks return.
    

Powell opened the door; the tape is now pricing the pace. With OAS ~49.6, fair-value chatter clusters low/mid-50s. Into core PCE (consensus: a small y/y uptick), risk to total return is **rates first**, spreads second. A persistent yield back-up plus firmer USD could nudge OAS toward **52–55**; a benign PCE/labor run would let carry grind toward the **mid-40s** (cycle-tights zone) before supply season re-sets valuations.

IG remains a duration-sensitive carry trade. Watch: **core PCE**, **Waller** later in the week, and quarter-end money markets.

Launch video for these models is here: [LINK](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/one-trade-to-rule-them-all-interest)

**Cumulative Implied Easing (to Dec 2026): –129.8 bp**  
**Terminal Rate (Dec 2026): 3.032% (~3.03%)**  
**September OIS Cut Probability: 81.6% — Implied Rate 4.126% | Implied Move –20.4 bp (~0.82×25)**

Versus yesterday, the front end is **shallower**: the total path eases **~8½ bp less** (–129.8 bp vs –138.5 bp) and the **terminal is ~8–9 bp higher** (~3.03% vs ~2.95%). September remains a 25 bp base case with solid odds (~82%), but the curve now sketches a steadier step-down rather than an acceleration.

*   **Reaction function:** Powell opened the door; markets are now pricing the _pace_. A modest back-up in yields and firmer USD nudged the terminal higher even as September odds held up.
    
*   **What it says:** The base case is a **calibration cut in September**, then measured trims into mid-’26; no hurry to race toward sub-3% unless data break softer.
    
*   **Risks to the path:** A hotter **core PCE** or stickier services inflation would cap September’s follow-through and bias the terminal higher; benign PCE + softer labor data re-deepens the path toward the mid-40s (bp of total easing) by early ’27.
    

Destination still lower, but the **glidepath tightened**: September ~25 bp, roughly **two cuts by year-end**, terminal near **3.0%** rather than the high-2s. Into the data window, **front-end P&L is about speed**, not direction hot prints shave the path; benign prints restore it.
