_**The Macro Regime Tracker offers a daily lens on how shifts in growth, inflation, and liquidity affect short-term risk and reward. Leveraging machine learning, AI, and cross-asset data, it identifies macro changes and their impact on market positioning.**_

I have laid out the trade implications of the regime we are currently in here:

Post Jackson Hole, the credit cycle remains intact. When we are in periods of time like this, the liquidity we experience sows the seeds of its own demise.

**When everything converges to the currency and interest rates like this, it is truly a risk because it can cause larger bear markets when it unwinds. We are NOT there yet, though! I remain bullish on risk assets on a cyclical basis. Understanding the signals around everything as we progress will be critical, though. If my strategies for risk assets turn bearish, then I will publish a report for paid subscribers on it immediately.**

_**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_

A calm, risk-on session into Nvidia’s print: the S&P rose +0.51% as Industrials/Financials/Tech did the heavy lifting. Long-end rates were choppy but the curve steepened (5s30s widest since ’21) amid renewed chatter about Fed independence after the move to oust Gov. Cook. A solid 2-yr sale (stop ~3.641%, bid/cover 2.69, strong indirects) underpinned the front end. Data were mixed-but-resilient: core capital goods orders beat (+1.1% m/m; shipments +0.7%) even as headline durables fell on aircraft. Dollar eased, crude inched up, and volatility remains pinned with funds heavily short VIX.

Offsets:

*   Information Technology (+0.18%), Financials (+0.13%), Industrials (+0.09%), Consumer Discretionary (+0.06%), Health Care (+0.03%), Materials (+0.01%), Communication Services (+0.01%).  
    Detractors/flat:
    
*   Consumer Staples (−0.02%), Real Estate (~−0.00%), Energy (0.00%), Utilities (0.00%).  
    Index: S&P 500 (+0.51%).
    

Leaders:

*   Industrials (+1.03%), Financials (+0.94%), Consumer Discretionary (+0.61%), Materials (+0.60%), Information Technology (+0.54%), Health Care (+0.30%).  
    Laggards:
    
*   Utilities (+0.21%), Energy (+0.14%), Communication Services (+0.08%), Real Estate (−0.11%), Consumer Staples (−0.36%).  
    Index: S&P 500 (+0.51%).
    

*   Fed independence headline risk: Markets still assume an independent Fed, but any escalation argues for a steeper curve risk premium at the long end; watch 5s30s.
    
*   Growth pulse: Core capex beat and positive shipments signal ongoing AI/capex resilience even as headline durables sag on aircraft.
    
*   Funding & front end: Strong 2-yr auction keeps the September-cut debate “how dovish vs how hawkish,” not “if.”
    
*   Positioning/vol: Extreme net shorts in VIX leave a low-vol regime vulnerable to a headline or earnings shock (NVDA, core PCE next).
    

The tape favored cyclicals over defensives with a classic “growth-without-panic” tone. Base-case: a September 25 bp calibration cut remains in play, while politics nudges term-premium/steepening risk. Near-term pivot points: Nvidia’s guidance, core PCE, and any further signals on Fed governance.

IG OAS: **49.65 bp** • 5-yr avg: **62.60 bp** (~13 bp inside) • Cycle low: **43.75 bp** (~5.9 bp off tights) • COVID high: **151.80 bp** (~102 bp tighter)

Spreads held the “4-handle” again as the rates tape did more of the talking. The curve **steepened (5s30s widest since ’21)** while the 10y finished ~**4.26% (-1 bp)** and the USD eased. A **solid 2-yr auction** (clean stop, firm indirects) anchored the front end. Headlines around **Fed governance** nudged term-premium chatter higher, but IG beta stayed orderly, carry did the work and primary remains selective into data.

*   **< 60 bp**: Duration-friendly, carry-positive zone for insurers, pensions, and liability-driven buyers.
    
*   **60–70 bp**: Macro noise threshold, where volatility or inflation threats prompt positioning cuts.
    
*   **\> 90 bp**: Systemic stress unlikely unless global macro or geopolitical shocks return.
    

*   **Growth pulse:** Core capex **beat (+1.1% m/m; shipments +0.7%)** supports the “AI/capex resilience” narrative even as headline durables sag on aircraft.
    
*   **Rates & curve:** Steeper long end = higher term-premium risk, but front-end anchoring plus cut odds keep the **“hawkish vs dovish cut”** debate intact rather than “if.”
    
*   **Fed-independence noise:** Markets still assume an independent Fed; escalation would pressure the long end first, not spreads, unless it dents equities/flows.
    
*   **Vol & positioning:** VIX shorts leave risk assets vulnerable to a headline shock (NVDA, core PCE), but in the absence of a surprise, **carry grind** favors IG.
    

IG remains a duration-sensitive carry trade; watch **core PCE**, **NVDA guidance**, and any further signals on **Fed governance**. Base case: **sub-50 holds** near-term with spread moves smaller than rate moves.

Cumulative Implied Easing (to Dec 2026): –135.1 bp  
Terminal Rate (Dec 2026): 2.979% (~2.98%)  
September OIS Cut Probability: 87.2% — Implied Rate 4.112% | Implied Move –21.8 bp (~0.87×25)

Versus yesterday, the front end turned a touch more dovish: the total path **deepens by ~5 bp** (–135.1 bp vs –129.8 bp) and the terminal **slips ~5 bp** to ~2.98%. September remains a 25 bp base case with stronger odds (~87%).

Reaction function: Powell opened the door; markets are now pricing the pace. A steeper curve (5s30s widest since ’21) and a firm 2-yr auction anchor the front end, while **Fed-independence headlines** add a smidge of term-premium at the long end. The **core capex beat** (+1.1% m/m; shipments +0.7%) keeps the “AI/capex resilience” narrative alive even as headline durables fell on aircraft.

What it says: Base case is a **calibration cut in September**, then measured trims through mid-’26; today’s glidepath is a little deeper with the terminal nudged below 3%.

• **Hot core PCE / sticky services** → trims slow; terminal biased higher.  
• **Benign PCE + softer labor** → path re-deepens toward the mid-40s (bp of additional easing) by late ’26.  
• **Governance noise** → pressures the long end more than the front; watch funding into quarter-end.

Destination remains lower; the **speed** is the variable. Into PCE/NVDA, front-end P&L is rates-led: hot prints shave cuts from 1H-’26; benign prints restore the step-down cadence with terminal just under 3%.
