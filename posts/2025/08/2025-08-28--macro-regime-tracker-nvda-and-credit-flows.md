_**The Macro Regime Tracker offers a daily lens on how shifts in growth, inflation, and liquidity affect short-term risk and reward. Leveraging machine learning, AI, and cross-asset data, it identifies macro changes and their impact on market positioning.**_

I laid out all of the macro views and trade write ups in a video today that can be found here:

_**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_

A constructive cash session gave way to softer futures after Nvidia’s revenue outlook ($54B ±2%) undershot lofty whispers and excluded China data-center sales. The S&P finished +0.36% in regular hours with Energy and Tech carrying the tape, while short-dated Treasuries stayed bid on easier-policy bets. Fed-independence headlines linger (Cook saga), with Treasury Sec. Bessent again urging an internal Fed review and signaling Powell-succession interviews after Labor Day. Oil eased, the dollar was little changed.

Offsets: Information Technology (+0.20%), Financials (+0.05%), Energy (+0.03%), Communication Services (+0.02%), Consumer Staples (+0.02%), Industrials (+0.01%), Consumer Discretionary (+0.01%), Materials (+0.01%).  
Detractors/flat: Health Care (0.00%), Real Estate (0.00%), Utilities (0.00%).  
Index: S&P 500 (+0.36%).

Leaders: Energy (+1.17%), Information Technology (+0.59%), Materials (+0.54%), Consumer Staples (+0.38%), Financials (+0.36%), Communication Services (+0.21%), Industrials (+0.15%).  
Laggards: Real Estate (+0.12%), Consumer Discretionary (+0.07%), Health Care (+0.04%), Utilities (+0.04%).  
Index: S&P 500 (+0.36%).

*   NVDA: Guide shy of the whisper and no China DC revenue in the forecast stoked “AI spend decel” fears; stock fell after hours and NDX futures slipped. Watch commentary on the GB300 transition and any China-compliant SKUs.
    
*   Rates/auctions: Front end firmed (prices up) as easing expectations persist. The 5-yr auction cleared a touch above WI with solid demand (bid/cover ~2.36, strong indirects ~60.5%), keeping funding conditions orderly.
    
*   Fed independence/politics: Cook removal attempt keeps a term-premium/steepening overhang even if day-to-day impact is modest; Bessent pushes for an internal review and starts the Powell-successor process post-Labor Day.
    
*   Trade policy drift: Secondary tariffs in focus (India), Mexico signaling higher China tariffs another small nudge toward stickier goods prices/supply-chain rerouting.
    
*   Cross-asset tone: WTI ~−0.6% on the day, gold flat, dollar little changed; vol remains subdued, leaving the tape sensitive to an earnings or policy headline.
    

Cash session strength was broad and cyclical enough to keep the “growth-without-panic” vibe alive, but the AI leader now has to re-earn the multiple. Base case: September 25 bp cut remains the market’s anchor; political noise sustains a mild steepening bias. Near-term pivots: Friday’s core PCE, and 5s30s behavior into quarter-end.

IG OAS: **50.30 bp** • 5-yr avg: **62.60 bp** (~12.3 bp inside) • Cycle low: **43.75 bp** (~6.6 bp off tights) • COVID high: **151.80 bp** (~101.5 bp tighter)

Spreads ticked ~0.6 bp wider but stayed in the “low-50s” comfort zone while rates did the heavy lifting. Cash equities were constructive, then futures faded after Nvidia’s revenue outlook ($54B ±2%) underwhelmed and excluded China data-center sales. Short-dated Treasuries stayed bid on easing expectations; the 5-yr auction cleared just above WI with solid demand (bid/cover ~2.36, indirects ~60.5%), keeping funding conditions orderly. Fed-governance noise lingered (Bessent urging an internal review; Powell-successor interviews after Labor Day), a mild term-premium overhang rather than a credit event.

*   **< 60 bp**: Duration-friendly, carry-positive zone for insurers, pensions, and liability-driven buyers.
    
*   **60–70 bp**: Macro noise threshold, where volatility or inflation threats prompt positioning cuts.
    
*   **\> 90 bp**: Systemic stress unlikely unless global macro or geopolitical shocks return.
    

*   **Earnings/AI:** NVDA guide shy of whispers and no China DC revenue feeds the “AI spend decel” worry, but capex leaders still anchor sentiment unless guidance cuts spread.
    
*   **Rates & curve:** Front-end bid with cut odds intact; steepening risk persists from politics/term premium, but moves in spreads remain smaller than moves in rates.
    
*   **Fed independence:** Cook saga = headline risk; markets still price an independent Fed. Any escalation hits the long end first before IG beta.
    
*   **Trade policy drift:** India secondary tariffs/Mexico’s talk on China tariffs add a small goods-price tailwind; not spread-moving yet.
    
*   **Primary/flows:** New issue calendar stays selective into core PCE; concessions disciplined, carry doing most of the work.
    

Core PCE, NVDA call color on GB300/China-compliant SKUs, and 5s30s behavior into month-/quarter-end. **Base case:** sub-51 holds near term; carry beats beta while rates set the tone.

Today is the last day that all the Interest Rate Sensitivity Models will be free. This would be a great time to do a free trial so you can review everything. Free Trial [LINK](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/5cf14480).

Launch video for these models is here: [LINK](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/one-trade-to-rule-them-all-interest)

Cumulative Implied Easing (to Dec 2026): –138.9 bp  
Terminal Rate (Dec 2026): 2.941% (~2.94%)  
September OIS Cut Probability: 86.0% — Implied Rate 4.115% | Implied Move –21.5 bp (~0.86×25)

Versus yesterday, the path is a touch deeper and the terminal a few bps lower (–138.9 vs –135.1; ~2.94% vs ~2.98%), while September odds ease slightly (86% vs 87.2%) but remain a 25 bp base case.

*   **NVDA wobble:** A softer revenue guide ($54B ±2%, no China DC revenue) dented post-close risk appetite, but doesn’t change the front-end anchor unless it broadens into capex cuts.
    
*   **Rates/auctions:** Front-end remains bid on easing expectations; the 5-yr cleared just above WI with solid demand (strong indirects), keeping funding orderly.
    
*   **Fed governance:** Cook saga lingers; Bessent urged an internal Fed review and starts Powell-successor interviews after Labor Day — a term-premium/steepening overhang, not a front-end event (yet).
    
*   **Trade noise:** Secondary tariffs (India) and Mexico’s talk of higher China tariffs = mild goods-price tailwind; watch for services stickiness in Friday’s core PCE.
    

Base case is a **calibration cut in September**, followed by measured trims through mid-’26; today’s glidepath is **a few bps deeper** with the terminal nudged below 3%.

Risks to the path

*   **Hot core PCE / sticky services:** slows cadence; terminal biased higher.
    
*   **Benign PCE + softer labor:** re-deepens the path toward the mid-140s bp by late ’26.
    
*   **Governance escalation:** pressures the long end/term premium first; spreads follow only if equities/flows crack.
    

Destination remains lower; **speed is the variable.** Into core PCE, front-end P&L is rates-led: hot prints shave 1H’26 cuts; benign prints restore the step-down with terminal just under 3%.
