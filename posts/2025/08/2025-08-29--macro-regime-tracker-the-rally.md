_**The Macro Regime Tracker offers a daily lens on how shifts in growth, inflation, and liquidity affect short-term risk and reward. Leveraging machine learning, AI, and cross-asset data, it identifies macro changes and their impact on market positioning.**_

We are seeing flows move in lockstep with the bullish ES trade I laid out for paid subscribers here:

And fading the NQ move on NVDA earnings here:

We are entering a period of time where understanding the inflation playbook will be the differentiator between success and failure. The entire playbook is laid out here:

_**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_

A tentative cash session drifted higher into the close, with gains concentrated in mega-cap Communication Services while most defensives sagged. Macro tone was “good growth, waiting on inflation”: 2Q GDP was revised up to 3.3% SAAR with core PCE at 2.5% (q/q saar), jobless claims held steady at 229k, and traders stayed focused on Friday’s core PCE print. Rates flattened (2-yr +2 bp to ~3.63%, 10-yr −3 bp to ~4.21%), the dollar slipped, WTI and gold inched higher. Dell’s upbeat guide helped the AI-infrastructure story; Nvidia chatter stayed in the background.

Offsets: Communication Services (+0.11%), Information Technology (+0.03%), Energy (+0.02%), Financials (+0.02%).  
Detractors/flat: Utilities (−0.02%), Real Estate (−0.01%), Consumer Staples (−0.01%), Industrials (−0.01%), Health Care (−0.01%), Consumer Discretionary (−0.00%), Materials (−0.00%).  
Index: S&P 500 (+0.13%).

Leaders: Communication Services (+1.10%), Energy (+0.77%), Financials (+0.16%), Information Technology (+0.08%).  
Laggards: Utilities (−0.70%), Real Estate (−0.30%), Consumer Staples (−0.29%), Materials (−0.10%), Industrials (−0.08%), Health Care (−0.16%), Consumer Discretionary (−0.03%).  
Index: S&P 500 (+0.13%).

*   Growth vs inflation: Upward GDP revision (3.3% SAAR) and steady core PCE (2.5% q/q saar) keep the “resilient growth, disinflation not done” narrative intact ahead of July core PCE (consensus ~2.9% y/y). Claims at 229k still signal a cooling-but-not-cracking labor market.
    
*   Rates & auction color: The curve flattened with front-end yields a touch higher and 10s lower. The 7-yr auction tailed modestly (~3.925% vs 3.922% WI) with softer bid/cover (2.49 vs 2.79 prior) but heavy indirect take-up orderly, not exuberant.
    
*   Liquidity: Money-market fund balances printed a fresh record (($4.19B), plenty of dry powder as policy approaches a pivot.
    
*   Micro tells: Comm Services’ outsized contribution underscores mega-cap leadership (META/GOOGL complex), while Utilities/REITs lagged with long rates slipping, more “risk leadership” than “duration bid.” Dell’s stronger AI server outlook supports the capex cycle even as NVDA’s guide scrutiny lingers.
    

A September 25 bp cut remains the market anchor; today’s flattening says “watch the front end” into PCE. In-line/softer core PCE likely extends the grind higher with leadership in AI-adjacent and comms; a hot print risks a brief de-risking and deeper flattening. Near-term pivots: Friday core PCE, 5s30s behavior into month/quarter-end, and whether Comm Services’ concentrated lift can broaden without defensives rolling over.

IG OAS: **50.12 bp** • 5-yr avg: **62.59 bp** (**12.5 bp inside**) • Cycle low: **43.75 bp** (**6.4 bp off tights**) • COVID high: **151.80 bp** (~**101.7 bp tighter**)

Spreads were essentially unchanged in a calm “rates-do-the-moving” tape: IG OAS hugged the low-50s as the curve flattened (2-yr +2 bp to ~3.63%, 10-yr −3 bp to ~4.21%). Cash equities were modestly higher, dollar softer, and haven metals/energy edged up supportive backdrop for carry over beta.

*   **< 60 bp**: Duration-friendly, carry-positive zone for insurers, pensions, and liability-driven buyers.
    
*   **60–70 bp**: Macro noise threshold, where volatility or inflation threats prompt positioning cuts.
    
*   **\> 90 bp**: Systemic stress unlikely unless global macro or geopolitical shocks return.
    

*   **Growth:** 2Q GDP revised up to **3.3% SAAR** with final sales **~1.9%**; claims **229k**—cooling, not cracking.
    
*   **Inflation:** Core PCE (2Q) steady at **2.5% q/q saar**; **July core PCE ~2.9% y/y** is the pivot for the front end.
    
*   **Rates & auctions:** The **7-yr** tailed ~0.3 bp (**3.925% vs 3.922% WI**), **bid/cover 2.49** with heavy indirects—orderly, not exuberant.
    
*   **Liquidity:** MMF balances at a **record ~$7.21T**; discount-window use eased to **$4.19B**—ample dry powder while cuts are priced by Oct (≈20 bp for Sep).
    
*   **Micro tells:** AI-capex tone constructive (Dell upbeat) even as NVDA guide debate lingers; not a spread event.
    

*   **Friday core PCE** vs ~2.9% y/y consensus; a mild miss likely extends the “carry grind.”
    
*   **Curve behavior (5s30s/2s10s)** into month/quarter-end—any re-steepening from politics/term premium matters more to returns than a 1–2 bp wiggle in OAS.
    
*   **AI-hardware guides** and capex signals (servers, power) for TMT/IG supply cadence.
    
*   **Next week’s payrolls** for confirmation of “cooling-but-resilient.”
