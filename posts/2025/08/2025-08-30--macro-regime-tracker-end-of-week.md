_**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_

Equities slipped into the weekend as tech weakness weighed on the tape, with Nvidia and AI-adjacent names leading declines. The S&P 500 fell −0.42% (Nasdaq 100 −1.3%), a move framed less by new macro shocks and more by positioning: month-end, seasonals, and profit-taking after record highs. Despite the pullback, the index remains on track for a fourth consecutive monthly gain as traders lean into a September Fed cut.

*   **Detractors:** Information Technology (−0.36%), Consumer Discretionary (−0.12%), Industrials (−0.06%).
    
*   **Offsets:** Health Care (+0.06%), Consumer Staples (+0.03%), Energy (+0.02%), Financials (+0.01%), Real Estate (+0.01%), Communication Services (+0.01%).
    
*   Index: **S&P 500 (−0.42%)**.
    

*   **Leaders:** Energy (+0.60%), Health Care (+0.69%), Consumer Staples (+0.58%), Real Estate (+0.48%).
    
*   **Laggards:** Information Technology (−1.07%), Consumer Discretionary (−1.17%), Industrials (−0.77%), Utilities (−0.26%).
    
*   Index: **S&P 500 (−0.42%)**.
    

**Consumer pulse:** July PCE landed in line (headline +0.2% m/m, core +0.3% m/m, +2.9% y/y), reinforcing resilience in demand even as inflation edges higher. Real personal spending (+0.3%) underscored that households are still spending through tariff-driven price pressures, though University of Michigan sentiment fell to 58.2, a three-month low.

**Rates & FX:** Treasuries were little changed (2-yr −1 bp to 3.62%, 10-yr +2 bp to 4.22%), the dollar flat into month-end. Market pricing still embeds two cuts this year, with September as the base case barring a blowout NFP next Friday.

**Seasonals:** The weakest month of the year for equities looms. As corporate buybacks fade and retail flow cools, volatility historically picks up. Traders are alert to how seasonal de-risking interacts with a still-intact “Fed pivot” narrative.

**Micro tells:** Tech weakness was broad (semis, AI servers, software) while defensives and energy offered ballast. The split between weighted contribution (Tech’s drag dominating) and unweighted breadth (Energy, Staples, Health Care positive) highlights the market’s ongoing reliance on mega-cap leadership—and the risks when it falters.

The index’s −0.42% slide says more about **seasonal positioning and tech leadership fragility** than about a fundamental macro shift. Core PCE kept the September cut live, but tariffs and service inflation complicate the Fed’s optics. Next week’s jobs report is the swing factor: a soft print would cement September easing, while any upside surprise could jar the “buy the dip” reflex. Into September, expect **macro resilience vs. seasonal headwinds** to define the tape.

**IG OAS:** 50.96 bp • 5-yr avg: 62.58 bp (≈12 bp inside) • Cycle low: 43.75 bp (7.2 bp off tights) • COVID high: 151.80 bp (~101 bp tighter)

Credit spreads were steady, with IG OAS glued to the low-50s even as equities sagged on a tech-led pullback. The spread backdrop remains carry-constructive, with rates and equities absorbing the volatility instead. Treasuries saw mild curve flattening (2-yr −1 bp to 3.62%, 10-yr +2 bp to 4.22%), the dollar was flat, and gold gained modestly. The message: credit is happy to sit still while beta assets digest seasonal headwinds.

*   **< 60 bp**: Duration-friendly, carry-positive zone for insurers, pensions, and liability-driven buyers.
    
*   **60–70 bp**: Macro noise threshold, where volatility or inflation threats prompt positioning cuts.
    
*   **\> 90 bp**: Systemic stress unlikely unless global macro or geopolitical shocks return.
    

*   **September payrolls:** Sub-60k would cement a cut, giving spreads a tailwind; upside surprise could test carry at the margin.
    
*   **Curve signals:** 5s30s/2s10s slope behavior matters more for IG returns than the 1–2 bp day-to-day in OAS.
    
*   **Seasonals:** Equities enter the weakest month of the year; any volatility spillover is the real test of whether low-50s OAS is “sticky” or vulnerable.
    
*   **Tariff pass-through:** Watch corporate commentary on margin compression—early signs from Caterpillar, Dell, and Marvell show costs are rising but not yet translating into credit stress.
    

IG spreads remain **remarkably insulated**, holding near five-year tights even as equities wobble and rates chop. With carry still compelling, the market is in a “don’t overthink it” mode: **ride the grind until labor cracks, or tariffs force a repricing**. Into September, the main swing factor is not spreads themselves but whether equity volatility + macro seasonals spill over. So far, IG credit is calling the bluff.
