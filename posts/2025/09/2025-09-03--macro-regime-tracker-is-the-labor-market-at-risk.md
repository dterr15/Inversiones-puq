_**The Macro Regime Tracker offers a daily lens on how shifts in growth, inflation, and liquidity affect short-term risk and reward. Leveraging machine learning, AI, and cross-asset data, it identifies macro changes and their impact on market positioning.**_

My view is that we continue to rally in equity indices and that the seasonality narratives floating around should be faded. I laid out the logic for this in the video today:

I want to cover several additional points.

First, the labor market prints for JOLTS, ADP, and NFP are all this week. My view is people are going to realize the labor market is completely fine and we are NOT at risk of an imminet recession. The UB contract trading BELOW the last NFP level is a critical signal in this:

A lot of people have been asking me about my Bitcoin view and nothing dramatic has changed. Bitcoin remain skewed to the upside on a cyclical basis BUT it is underperforming ES significantly on a volatility adjusted basis. I don’t think there is cause for concern for the larger trend to break down but I always weigh being leverage long Bitcoin against being leverage long ES.

I expect the Nikkei to rally, but we have been consolidating in a range over the last two trading days:

_**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_
