This is starting off the month of September to show that the uninformed narratives around bearish seasonality are misplaced:

As I laid out in the macro report, the flows of capital are systematically moving out the risk curve as the Fed is taking its stance. A cut for Sept is fuctionally a done deal and completely priced now. The entire question from here will be if we get 25bps or 50bps of additional cuts before the end of the year.

As always, the systematic strategies and models are laid out below.
