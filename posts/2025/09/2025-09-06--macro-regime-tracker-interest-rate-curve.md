_**The Macro Regime Tracker offers a daily lens on how shifts in growth, inflation, and liquidity affect short-term risk and reward. Leveraging machine learning, AI, and cross-asset data, it identifies macro changes and their impact on market positioning.**_

I laid out my view for how to think about the NFP print as we put the labor market data behind us and look to the Sept FOMC meeting:

I continue to believe we are in a credit cycle upturn. I explained on August 28 that due to the changes we are seeing in rates across the curve, I went neutral on bonds:

Its clear post the NFP print that the rally in ZT, ZF, ZN, ZB, and UB was incredibly aggressive. This is really where positioning and marginal cyclical impulses are coming in contact with the larger structural reality. We are in a period of higher nominal GDP and the PATH forward creates significant headwinds for bonds. However, this doesn’t mean we can’t see marginal rallies against the structural regime.

The interest rate sensitivity model (these are linked below) is showing that downward movements in yields are creating an upward skew for equities. In other words, we are between a reflation and Goldilocks regime. We are NOT in a period of time where higher rates are dragging on equities OR a fall in rates is a response to a recession. As we operate in the interium, interest rate risk will define EVERYTHING. The more Goldilocks type pricing we see, the greater the upside for Gold and Equities as the DXY is at risk of moving to 96.

_**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_
