_**The Macro Regime Tracker offers a daily lens on how shifts in growth, inflation, and liquidity affect short-term risk and reward. Leveraging machine learning, AI, and cross-asset data, it identifies macro changes and their impact on market positioning.**_

From a macro perspective, I remain bullish equities, bullish gold and bullish Bitcoin. The probability of a recession is dropping as the market over extrapolates short term labor data and prices significant cuts in the forward curve. Within this regime we are seeing specific expressions of capital moving out the risk curve.

The Bitcoin and MSTR view is laid out here:

The [HYPD 0.00%↑](https://substack.com/discover/stocks/HYPD) view and video breakdown connects to this (this is up almost 70% since when I first shared it with paid subscribers):

We then saw further news regarding Hyperliquid today:

I remain long ES in the risk reward I laid out here:

And I remain long gold:

The macro environment has aligned to have a lot of incredibly trends but managing risk remains paramount! After the CPI print tomorrow, I will be writing an updated report on how to think about inflation risk, recession risk and the Fed given the updates we are seeing. This would be a great time to become a paid subscriber because the challenges with the Fed, currency, and interest rate volatility will only increase from here on out.

I would strongly encourage everyone to review the interest rate guide here (I made it 100% free because it will set the foundation for the more in depth analysis I publish this week).

Finally, this was a really good short video on how to approach markets by my friend [Skigod](https://open.substack.com/users/9706168-skigod?utm_source=mentions). I referenced some of our conversations and why having the proper approach to your daily life is critical for seeing asymmetrical opportunities. It’s well worth it.

_**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_
