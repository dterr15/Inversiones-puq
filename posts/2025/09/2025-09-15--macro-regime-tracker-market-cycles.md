I continue to believe we are in a unique period where significant liquidity is entering public markets and the underlying economy remains resilient. The Fed is cutting into this, which is pushing capital out the risk curve, the dollar lower, and gold higher. All of this continues to move in lockstep with the other trades I laid out here:

As always, all the systematic models and strategies are laid out below.

_**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_

The S&P 500 closed modestly higher (+0.11%), setting fresh highs as traders leaned into certainty of a September Fed cut. Treasuries firmed, with 2-year yields hovering at the lowest levels since last September, while the dollar slipped. Optimism on easing kept equity flows buoyant, but sector rotation signaled caution: defensives lagged and cyclical weakness left breadth narrow.

Momentum from megacap tech and communication services extended the index’s record-breaking run, even as most sectors traded in the red. With Powell’s guidance and the updated SEP dot plot due mid-week, markets remain focused not on “if” but “how fast” the Fed will ease.

**Weighted Return Contribution to Index**

*   Information Technology (+0.26%) and Communication Services (+0.17%) drove index gains.
    
*   Industrials (+0.01%) provided a marginal offset.
    
*   Financials (–0.07%), Health Care (–0.09%), and Consumer sectors (–0.05% each for Staples/Discretionary) were notable drags.
    
*   Other sectors contributed close to zero.
    

**Sector Performance (Unweighted Breadth)**

*   Communication Services (+1.60%) and Information Technology (+0.76%) dominated gains, extending momentum in growth sectors.
    
*   Industrials (+0.07%) eked out a small positive.
    
*   Defensives underperformed: Staples (–1.09%), Health Care (–1.02%), and Utilities (–0.10%).
    
*   Cyclicals dragged: Materials (–0.70%), Energy (–0.43%), and Financials (–0.50%).
    

**S&P 500 Index: +0.11%**

**Fed Countdown**  
Markets remain fully priced for a September 25 bp cut, with the focus shifting to Powell’s tone and the dot plot trajectory. Labor market softening has sealed the deal, but inflation expectations remain stubbornly above 2%. Policymakers are expected to emphasize balance: easing enough to cushion employment but avoiding signals of an aggressive cutting cycle.

**Positioning & Flows**  
The rally remains concentrated, with megacap tech and communications carrying the tape. The defensive bid that supported utilities and staples last week reversed, suggesting investors are less interested in pure safety and more focused on sectors with earnings resilience plus rate sensitivity.

**Rates & Commodities**  
Treasuries extended their rally into the Fed meeting, with the curve holding its recent steepening bias. The dollar softened further, while gold climbed near record highs and oil recovered modestly, consistent with easing expectations and geopolitical hedging.

The index gain masked narrow leadership: tech and communications absorbed the bulk of flows, while cyclicals and defensives alike underperformed. The setup remains one of “insurance cuts without crisis” but the real inflection comes Wednesday with Powell’s press conference and the dots.

*   **Base Case:** September cut delivered, Powell stresses data dependence rather than committing to a sequence.
    
*   **Risks:** A cautious Fed tone could stall equities; faster labor deterioration could accelerate cuts beyond current pricing.
    
*   **Positioning Lens:** Favor growth sectors (Tech, Comms) with earnings momentum, alongside selective rate-sensitives. Cyclicals likely to remain under pressure until clarity emerges on pace of easing.
    

The rally is still intact, but leadership is narrowing. With the Fed about to reset expectations, the market remains perched between optimism on cuts and fragility in breadth. Wednesday is the hinge: Powell’s ability to reassure without overcommitting will decide whether this record run broadens out or stalls at the top.

IG spreads edged tighter into the Fed, reinforcing the “carry first, volatility second” regime. Bloomberg IG OAS prints ~**46.99 bp**, leaving credit **~15.5 bp inside** the five-year average and only **~3.3 bp** off the cycle low. With the S&P at fresh highs, 2-yr yields near the lows since last September, and the dollar softer, credit is signaling confidence in “cuts without crisis.”

*   **IG OAS:** **~47.0 bp** (chart last: 46.994)
    
*   **5-yr average:** **62.5 bp** → **~15.5 bp inside**
    
*   **Cycle low:** **43.8 bp** → **~3.2 bp off tights**
    
*   **COVID peak:** **151.8 bp** → **~105 bp tighter**
    

*   **< 60 bp**: Duration-friendly, carry-positive zone for insurers, pensions, and liability-driven buyers.
    
*   **60–70 bp**: Macro noise threshold, where volatility or inflation threats prompt positioning cuts.
    
*   **\> 90 bp**: Systemic stress unlikely unless global macro or geopolitical shocks return.
    

*   **Macro tape:** Equities at records; Nasdaq winning streak extended. A framework to keep TikTok operating in the US helped tech sentiment. Labor data remain softening-not-collapsing; no fresh inflation shock.
    
*   **Policy path:** Markets fully priced for a **25 bp cut in September**; debate is about _pace_ thereafter. Powell’s tone and the dots are the swing factors.
    
*   **Rates/backdrop:** Treasuries bid (2s near YTD lows), dollar softer; gold firm, oil modestly higher consistent with easing expectations and benign growth.
    
*   **Credit tone:** Primary well-absorbed with light concessions; secondary two-way but balanced. ETFs and real-money demand continue to pin OAS in the high-40s.
    

*   **Guidance surprise:** A cautious, “wait-and-see” Powell could rekindle rates vol → **+2–5 bp** to OAS.
    
*   **Labor slippage:** Faster claims/payroll deterioration would pressure lower-tier IG and cyclicals.
    
*   **Steepener shock:** Growth-scare steepening is more problematic for spreads than a supply-led selloff.
    
*   **Liquidity windows:** Heavy calendars into thin tape can stall the grind and widen idiosyncratically.
    

IG continues to price **insurance easing without a growth accident**. At ~47 bp, the next ~10 bp is about **Fed communication and rates vol**, not micro credit fundamentals. Unless the labor cooldown accelerates or inflation expectations re-re-accelerate, dips should be **brief and bought** but **carry discipline and liquidity respect** matter at these valuations.

Pre-Fed calm favors carry. With OAS a whisker off cycle tights and equities at highs, credit is granting the Fed the benefit of the doubt: cut, keep optionality, avoid promising a sequence. If Powell threads that needle, spreads can stay pinned; if he blinks hawkish or data crack, the first move is rates vol credit follows, but from a position of strength.
