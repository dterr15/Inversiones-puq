The S&P 500 slipped 0.25%, snapping the Nasdaq 100’s nine-day winning streak, as investors paused ahead of Wednesday’s Fed decision. Treasuries stayed firm with 20-year supply absorbed smoothly, the dollar weakened further, and gold briefly topped $3,700/oz. Solid retail-sales data underscored consumer resilience, but only sharpened debate over the pace of policy easing.

Breadth narrowed meaningfully: tech leadership faded, cyclicals underperformed, and defensives failed to provide shelter as utilities plunged. Energy stood out as the lone bright spot, with crude buoyed by geopolitical risks and supply pressure.

**Weighted Return Contribution to Index**

*   Biggest drag: Information Technology (–0.21%)
    
*   Other negatives: Industrials (–0.05%), Utilities (–0.04%), Financials (–0.01%), Materials (–0.01%), Real Estate (–0.01%)
    
*   Positives: Energy (+0.03%), Consumer Discretionary (+0.02%), Communication Services (+0.01%)
    
*   Net impact: S&P 500 (–0.25%)
    

**Sector Performance (Unweighted Breadth)**

*   Energy (+0.96%) surged, extending crude’s rebound.
    
*   Consumer Discretionary (+0.23%), Staples (+0.07%), and Communication Services (+0.11%) posted modest gains.
    
*   Information Technology (–0.61%) and Materials (–0.60%) led declines.
    
*   Industrials (–0.55%) and Real Estate (–0.55%) were also weak.
    
*   Utilities (–1.56%) saw sharp underperformance, dragging defensives lower.
    
*   S&P 500 Index: –0.25%
    

**Fed Countdown**  
Markets remain fully priced for a 25 bp cut on Wednesday. Strong retail-sales data (+0.6% headline, +0.7% control group) confirmed consumer momentum, dampening hopes for an aggressive dovish turn. Powell’s statement and the dot plot are the focus: the balance will be between cushioning labor-market softness and avoiding a “stimulus now, regret later” narrative.

**Flows & Positioning**  
Unlike yesterday’s tech-led strength, growth leadership faltered, and no broad rotation filled the gap. Utilities’ collapse signals little demand for traditional defensives, while energy was the standout beneficiary of both supply tension and hedging flows. The market tone has shifted toward “waiting mode” rather than chasing highs.

**Rates & Commodities**  
Treasuries held gains, with the 2-year at 3.51% and the curve steady. The dollar touched multi-week lows, the euro climbed to its strongest since 2021, and yen strengthened. Gold pierced $3,700/oz, reflecting both easing bets and geopolitical hedging. Oil extended gains amid Russia/Mideast risks.

The market is locked in before the Fed. Breadth has deteriorated: energy is the only real outperformer, while utilities and tech leadership cracked. Consumer resilience keeps the macro backdrop constructive but complicates the dovish story. The stage is set for Powell: reassure without overcommitting, or risk a “sell the news” pullback.

*   **Base Case:** 25 bp cut delivered, Powell emphasizes optionality and data dependence.
    
*   **Risks:** Hawkish dots or cautious tone could stall equities; consumer strength may limit future cuts.
    
*   **Positioning Lens:** Energy offers tactical outperformance; growth sectors need Powell to validate easing. Utilities’ collapse highlights fragility in defensives.
    

The tape is stalling at the top, leadership narrowing. Tomorrow’s Fed decision is the hinge: the outcome will dictate whether the rally broadens or fragments further.

Investment-grade credit remains steady into the Fed decision, with Bloomberg IG OAS closing near 47.5 bp. That leaves spreads ~15 bp inside the five-year average (62.5 bp) and only ~3.7 bp off the cycle tights. The stability underscores how strongly carry continues to dominate positioning, even as equity momentum wobbles and rates volatility looms ahead of Powell’s remarks.

*   **IG OAS:** ~47.5 bp (chart last: 47.453)
    
*   **5-yr average:** 62.5 bp → ~15 bp inside
    
*   **Cycle low:** 43.8 bp → ~3.7 bp off tights
    
*   **COVID peak:** 151.8 bp → ~105 bp tighter
    

*   **< 60 bp**: Duration-friendly, carry-positive zone for insurers, pensions, and liability-driven buyers.
    
*   **60–70 bp**: Macro noise threshold, where volatility or inflation threats prompt positioning cuts.
    
*   **\> 90 bp**: Systemic stress unlikely unless global macro or geopolitical shocks return.
    

**Macro tape:** Equities eased (S&P –0.25%, Nasdaq ended a nine-day streak) shifting fully into “waiting mode.” Retail sales beat expectations (+0.6% headline, +0.7% control group), reinforcing consumer resilience but complicating the case for aggressive dovish guidance.

**Policy path:** A 25 bp cut tomorrow is fully priced. The debate is over Powell’s tone and the dot plot: markets want a cushion for labor but not a signal of crisis.

**Rates/backdrop:** Treasuries remained well-bid, with 2s at 3.51% and 20-year supply smoothly absorbed. Dollar drifted lower, euro and yen stronger, gold pierced $3,700/oz, and oil extended gains on geopolitical risk.

**Credit tone:** Primary issuance was well absorbed with light concessions; secondary markets saw two-way flow but balanced demand. ETF inflows and real-money buyers continue to anchor spreads near the mid-40s.

*   **Fed tone:** A cautious Powell or hawkish dots could spark rates vol and widen OAS 2–5 bp.
    
*   **Labor prints:** A sharper deterioration would pressure lower-tier IG and cyclical sectors.
    
*   **Curve dynamics:** Growth-scare steepening is a bigger credit risk than supply-led back-up.
    
*   **Liquidity:** Heavy primary calendars into thin conditions could stall the grind.
    

Credit is still pricing “insurance cuts without crisis.” At ~47.5 bp, the next 5–10 bp move hinges less on micro fundamentals and more on Fed communication and rates volatility. Unless labor cracks faster or inflation re-accelerates, dips are likely shallow and bought, but valuations demand discipline.

IG spreads remain pinned in the high-40s, granting Powell the benefit of the doubt. If he threads the needle; cutting, stressing optionality, avoiding promises of a sequence, credit can stay anchored. If he surprises hawkish or the data crack, the first move is in rates vol; credit follows, but from a position of strength.
