_**The Macro Regime Tracker offers a daily lens on how shifts in growth, inflation, and liquidity affect short-term risk and reward. Leveraging machine learning, AI, and cross-asset data, it identifies macro changes and their impact on market positioning.**_

I laid out all the macro view here:

As always, all the systematic models and strategies are updated below.

**Tariffs / Trade Policy**

*   _NIKE LIFTS VIEW OF INCREMENTAL TARIFF COSTS FROM PRIOR $1B_
    
*   _NIKE CFO SEES $1.5B OF INCREMENTAL COSTS FROM TARIFFS_
    
*   _FED’S GOOLSBEE SAYS US SEEMS HEADED INTO NEW WAVE OF TARIFFS_
    
*   _GOOLSBEE: MOST OF RECENT INFLATION RISE FROM TARIFFS_
    
*   _GOOLSBEE: HOPING FOR MODEST, ONE-TIME IMPACT FROM TARIFFS_
    
*   _GOOLSBEE: IF INFL. MORE PERSISTENT, WOULD BE DIFFICULT SCENARIO_
    
*   _COLLINS: PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH MIGHT HELP LIMIT TARIFF INFLATION_
    
*   _COLLINS: NO LONGER EXPECTING AS LARGE A TARIFF INFLATION IMPACT_
    
*   _USTR GREER EXPECTS TRUMP TO SIGN TRADE DEALS ON ASIA TRIP_
    

**Fed / Monetary Policy**

*   _FED TO EASE MORGAN STANLEY’S CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AFTER REVIEW_
    
*   _GOOLSBEE: UNCOMFORTABLE FRONTLOADING A WHOLE BUNCH OF RATE CUTS_
    
*   _GOOLSBEE: HOLDING RATES STEADY AS INFLATION RISES IS LIKE A CUT_
    
*   _GOOLSBEE: HARD TO EXPLAIN RISE IN SERVICES INFLATION_
    
*   _GOOLSBEE: SHORT GOV. SHUTDOWNS HAVE LITTLE IMPACT ON ECONOMY_
    
*   _GOOLSBEE: BLS IS BEST DATA PROVIDER IN THE WORLD_
    
*   _COLLINS: VERY STRONG EQUITY MARKETS BOOSTING HOUSEHOLD WEALTH_
    
*   _COLLINS: HIGHER HOUSEHOLD WEALTH PART OF STRONGER CONSUMPTION_
    
*   _COLLINS: MODESTLY OR MILDLY RESTRICTIVE STANCE IS APPROPRIATE_
    
*   _FED’S COLLINS: MANY INDICATORS MAKE LABOR SOFTENING QUITE CLEAR_
    

**Shutdown / Fiscal Risk**

*   _TRUMP: HAVE TO DO LAYOFFS WITH SHUTDOWN_
    
*   _TRUMP ON SHUTDOWN: PROBABLY LIKELY_
    
*   _TRUMP: WE CAN DO THINGS DURING SHUTDOWN THAT ARE IRREVERSIBLE_
    
*   _CHAVEZ-DEREMER: SHUTDOWN WILL HALT UNEMPLOYMENT PROGRESS_
    
*   _CHAVEZ-DEREMER: BLS REPORT WILL BE DELAYED IN EVENT OF SHUTDOWN_

_**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_

The S&P 500 climbed 0.51%, with the quarter closing on a firmer note despite looming risks around Friday’s nonfarm payrolls release. Sector performance was bifurcated: Health Care surged on policy-sensitive flows, while cyclicals like Energy and Financials lagged. The overarching backdrop remains defined by the approaching government shutdown, which could black out key labor and inflation data that anchors the Fed’s reaction function.

**Weighted Return Contribution to Index**

*   Leaders: Info Tech (+0.27%), Industrials (+0.08%), Health Care (+0.22%).
    
*   Drags: Financials (–0.06%), Consumer Discretionary (–0.04%), Energy (–0.01%).
    
*   Net: S&P 500 +0.51%.
    

**Sector Performance (Unweighted Breadth)**

*   Winners: Health Care (+2.45%), Materials (+1.00%), Industrials (+0.92%), Info Tech (+0.79%), Real Estate (+0.38%), Staples (+0.31%).
    
*   Losers: Energy (–0.49%), Financials (–0.42%), Discretionary (–0.37%).
    
*   Net: S&P 500 +0.51%.
    

**Shutdown & Data Risk**  
Markets remain fixated on the shutdown countdown. If triggered, Friday’s BLS payrolls release would be delayed, depriving the Fed of high-frequency labor signals at a critical juncture. Historical precedent shows limited GDP and equity fallout from short shutdowns, but the _information vacuum_ risk is acute for a data-dependent Fed.

**Fed Speak**

*   **Goolsbee (Chicago):** Warned tariffs are contributing to stickier inflation and cautioned against “frontloading” cuts.
    
*   **Collins (Boston):** Signaled further easing may be needed given labor softening, though inflation persistence remains a risk.
    
*   **Jefferson (Vice Chair):** Stressed the Fed faces downside risks on jobs alongside upside risks on inflation, highlighting the two-sided policy bind.
    

**Macro Data**

*   Consumer Confidence fell to **94.2** (five-month low), with the “jobs plentiful” share at its weakest since 2021.
    
*   JOLTS showed little change in job openings (**7.23m**), reinforcing the view of gradual labor market cooling.
    

The Fed’s path remains _gradual and conditional_: October cut odds are alive but not pre-signaled. The sharper divergence in sector leadership; Health Care, Tech, Materials carrying the tape while Energy and Financials fade, reflects positioning for a world of slower growth, policy easing, and tariff-related inflation tail risks.

**Takeaway:** With consumer confidence slipping and shutdown risks muddying the data stream, the market is leaning on defensives and rate-sensitive growth, hedging uncertainty rather than embracing a risk-on narrative.

Investment-grade spreads remain locked in the “carry channel,” Bloomberg US IG OAS printing at ~52.1 bp (chart last: 52.070). That’s virtually unchanged from yesterday and still ~10 bp inside the 5-yr average (~62.4). The regime remains firmly low-50s: carry-positive, resilient to macro chop, but capped by headline risk.

*   **IG OAS:** ~52.1 bp
    
*   **5-yr avg:** ~62.4 bp → ~10 bp inside
    
*   **Cycle tights:** ~43.8 bp → ~8–9 bp away
    
*   **’22 wides:** ~111 bp → ~59 bp tighter
    

**Read:** Spreads are grinding, not breaking. The carry-friendly zone is intact; the only way tighter is if shutdown risks fade and labor cools smoothly.

*   **< 60 bp**: Duration-friendly, carry-positive zone for insurers, pensions, and liability-driven buyers.
    
*   **60–70 bp**: Macro noise threshold, where volatility or inflation threats prompt positioning cuts.
    
*   **\> 90 bp**: Systemic stress unlikely unless global macro or geopolitical shocks return.
    

*   **Shutdown risk:** Friday’s payrolls release may not print if the government closes. Markets are treating this as _visibility risk_, not GDP risk, but event-gap danger rises the longer the data blackout lasts.
    
*   **Data:** JOLTS showed job openings steady at **7.23m**, consumer confidence slumped to **94.2** (five-month low). Labor cooling is visible, but without Friday’s NFP, confirmation may be delayed.
    
*   **Fed speak:**
    
    *   **Goolsbee (Chicago):** Tariffs feeding into inflation, warns against over-frontloading cuts.
        
    *   **Collins (Boston):** Further cuts plausible on labor weakness, but inflation risk lingers.
        
    *   **Jefferson (Vice Chair):** Both sides of the mandate under pressure — jobs softening, inflation sticky.
        

*   **Data blackout:** Missing NFP/Inflation prints complicates Fed communication and repricing risk.
    
*   **Tariff pass-through:** Sector-specific cost pressure (importers) could widen idiosyncratic IG names.
    
*   **Rates dynamic:** Bull steepener from growth scare is more credit-hostile than a parallel rally.
    

**Base case:** IG OAS grinds sideways in low-50s. Carry appeal intact; insurers, pensions, and LDI buyers stay engaged.  
**Risk case:** If shutdown prolongs and jobs data blackout coincides with tariff noise, credit could cheapen toward high-50s.
