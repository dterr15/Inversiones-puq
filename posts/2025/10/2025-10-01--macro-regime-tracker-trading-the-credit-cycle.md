_**The Macro Regime Tracker offers a daily lens on how shifts in growth, inflation, and liquidity affect short-term risk and reward. Leveraging machine learning, AI, and cross-asset data, it identifies macro changes and their impact on market positioning.**_

I recorded a full livestream today explaining how I am trading the credit cycle here:

_**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_

The S&P 500 rose 0.79%, extending its rally to a fourth straight session and closing at a fresh record high. Strength came from defensives and rate-sensitive growth sectors, with Health Care and Info Tech providing the bulk of the lift, while Financials and Materials lagged. The backdrop remains defined by the government shutdown, which threatens to delay Friday’s payrolls release, leaving the Fed reliant on private data and proxies to gauge labor momentum.

**Sector Attribution**

_Weighted Return Contribution to Index_

*   Leaders: Info Tech (+0.43%), Health Care (+0.22%), Consumer Discretionary (+0.12%).
    
*   Drags: Financials (–0.09%), Materials (–0.02%), Staples (–0.01%).
    
*   Net: S&P 500 +0.79%.
    

_Sector Performance (Unweighted Breadth)_

*   Winners: Health Care (+2.43%), Info Tech (+1.23%), Consumer Discretionary (+1.12%), Industrials (+0.36%).
    
*   Losers: Materials (–1.00%), Financials (–0.65%), Staples (–0.17%).
    
*   Net: S&P 500 +0.79%.
    

**Macro Overlay**

_Shutdown & Data Void_  
Markets appear unfazed by the first US government shutdown in nearly seven years. Equities leaned on sector rotation rather than broad macro momentum, even as the looming data blackout could deprive the Fed of its most important high-frequency read on the labor market.

_Labor Market Signals_  
ADP data showed private payrolls fell 32k in September, the second consecutive monthly decline and well below expectations. ISM manufacturing pointed to contraction for the seventh straight month, though employment and production improved slightly. Together, the reports reinforced the “low-hire, low-fire” labor environment, consistent with Fed easing expectations.

_Rates & Commodities_  
Treasuries rallied, with the 10-year yield dipping toward 4.10%. Gold extended to fresh record highs as the dollar held steady. Oil inventories rose modestly, though Cushing stocks declined again, underscoring fragile balance in physical supply.

**The Read-Through**

The Fed’s October meeting remains live for another “insurance” cut, with investors leaning on the view that officials have enough evidence of labor market cooling even without the BLS payrolls print. Sector leadership Health Care, Tech, and Discretionary pulling ahead while Financials and Materials slump, reflects a market hedging toward policy-sensitive defensives and growth, not a broad embrace of cyclical recovery.

**Takeaway:** With shutdown politics muddying the data stream and ADP pointing to slower job growth, the market is relying on defensives and rate-sensitive growth leadership. The bias is toward caution, not capitulation, as investors hedge for a slower-growth, lower-rate path.

IG spreads remain pinned in the carry channel. Bloomberg US IG OAS prints **~52.1 bp** (chart last: **52.098**), essentially unchanged as equities grind higher and 10s rally toward ~4.10%. The market is treating the government shutdown as a _visibility_ problem more than a _growth_ shock; spreads are grinding, not breaking.

**Credit context (where we sit) — from the chart**

*   **IG OAS:** ~**52.1 bp**
    
*   **5-yr avg:** **~64.8 bp** → ~**13 bp inside**
    
*   **Cycle tights:** **~43.8 bp** → ~**8 bp away**
    
*   **Pandemic wides:** **~151.8 bp** → ~**100 bp tighter**  
    _(Chart stats: Last 52.098 | High 151.798 on 03/20/20 | Avg 64.825 | Low 43.750 on 02/13/20.)_
    

*   **< 60 bp**: Duration-friendly, carry-positive zone for insurers, pensions, and liability-driven buyers.
    
*   **60–70 bp**: Macro noise threshold, where volatility or inflation threats prompt positioning cuts.
    
*   **\> 90 bp**: Systemic stress unlikely unless global macro or geopolitical shocks return.
    

*   **Risk backdrop:** S&P at a fresh high; fourth up day. Gold to a record; dollar steady. 10-year ~4.10% after a small rally.
    
*   **Shutdown:** Data blackout likely delays BLS payrolls; Fed forced to lean on private proxies. Market still prices further easing.
    
*   **Labor signal:** **ADP –32k** (second monthly drop) and **ISM manufacturing still in contraction**, consistent with a “low-hire, low-fire” slowdown rather than a shock.
    

**How this maps to credit**

*   **Primary market:** Window stays open; no systemic concession creep. Idiosyncratic stories matter more than index direction.
    
*   **Path to tighter:** Needs a short shutdown, orderly labor cooling, and benign inflation prints that keep Fed cuts alive.
    
*   **Path to wider:** A prolonged data blackout with headline layoffs, or a growth scare/bull steepener that pressures cyclical cashflows.
    

Base case is a **sideways grind in the low-50s** with carry doing the heavy lifting. Risk case pushes toward the high-50s if the shutdown lingers and labor softness meets policy noise. Until then, IG remains a **carry market**
