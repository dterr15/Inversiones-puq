_**The Macro Regime Tracker offers a daily lens on how shifts in growth, inflation, and liquidity affect short-term risk and reward. Leveraging machine learning, AI, and cross-asset data, it identifies macro changes and their impact on market positioning.**_

Since FOMC, we have seen the DXY rise. This is primarily driven by monetary policy differentials as opposed to a dollar shortage, causing risk off behavior in equities:

As we moved into FOMC, I explained the causal drivers behind the dollar and the potential for a bottom here:

Here is the basic idea, since the Fed and the market have baked in 2 more cuts for this year, everyone is shifting to HOW MANY cuts take place in 2026. The SOFR spread below shows how many cuts the market is pricing in 2026, all the way till Sept of 2027 (which is where the terminal rate sits). So if we assume two cuts are happening this year, as the white line in the chart below moves DOWN, we price more cuts and fuctionally inject a lower price of money into the system. Inversely, if we move UP, we are pricing fewer cuts in the system, which functionally increases the price of money in the system for dollars. The blue line in the chart below shows the same period of time in the Eurozone which has actually fallen over the last 10 trading days. The bottom line is the US as priced less cuts since FOMC while the Eurozone only moved marginally. The net result is the dollar rising against the Euro.

This is why the spread is moving in lockstep with the DXY:

Now think about this for a moment, if the Eurozone just priced marginally more cuts as the US tightened a bit, does it begin to make sense why the DAX has outperformed US equities over the last 15 or so trading days?

This is why I laid out the long DAX view in the recent macro report (for paid subscribers):

You can see we have moved in lockstep with the risk reward:

Now, to be clear, we are not seeing the stronger dollar pull broad equity indicies down. Why? Because it is a shift in monetary policy differentials, not a shortage of dollars, causing systemic risk. The effect is being felt, though, why is why we are seeing the Russell underperform the NASDAQ marginally as the dollar has been making its upward moves:

The implication of these flows is that we are NOT seeing an imminent driver that would end the bull market. I remain long and explained how I am thinking about the redundancy planning here: (baseline is remaining above the 6660 FOMC level)

As I laid out here, we remain in a very bullish environment and sentiment isn’t going to change the direction of the S&P500. The only thing that moves the market is flows. In today’s social media attention market, the bearishness or bullishness doesn’t have predictability on directionality in ES, even if it overlaps occasionally with hindsight bias.

_**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_

The index cooled as rising yields and a firmer dollar nudged crowded AI/growth leadership to pause while cyclicals did the heavy lifting on the downside. Breadth weakened: seven sectors fell, with Energy, Industrials, and Materials leading declines. Fed rhetoric stayed easing-biased (Williams), but with data visibility still patchy, earnings are set to carry more macro weight near-term.

**Weighted Return Contribution (to S&P −0.40%)**

*   Leaders: Consumer Discretionary **(+0.03%)**, Consumer Staples **(+0.01%)**, Communication Services **(+0.01%)**
    
*   Laggards: Industrials **(−0.14%)**, Financials **(−0.08%)**, Info Tech **(−0.08%)**, Energy **(−0.06%)**, Health Care **(−0.04%)**, Materials **(−0.03%)**, Utilities **(−0.02%)**, Real Estate **(−0.01%)**
    

**Unweighted Performance (Breadth)**

*   Leaders: Consumer Discretionary **(+0.31%)**, Consumer Staples **(+0.26%)**, Communication Services **(+0.14%)**
    
*   Laggards: Energy **(−1.95%)**, Materials **(−1.74%)**, Industrials **(−1.67%)**, Utilities **(−0.67%)**, Real Estate **(−0.65%)**, Financials **(−0.62%)**, Info Tech **(−0.24%)**
    
*   **S&P 500 (cap-weighted): −0.40%**
    

**Flows & positioning:** After a powerful run, breadth is tiring and “buy-the-dip” is meeting a bit more resistance. AI remains the secular bid, but today’s tape favored defensives at the margin while economically sensitive groups (Energy/Industrials/Materials) bore the brunt.

**Rates & FX:** 10-yr USTs edged up to ~**4.14%**, curve little changed; **USD** pushed to a 10-week high—both consistent with the cyclical softness in equities. Gold slipped back below **$4,000/oz**; oil fell as Middle East risk premia eased.

**Fed tone:** NY Fed’s **Williams** reiterated openness to more cuts this year if labor softens further. That keeps the easing bias alive, but without fresh government data, markets will lean harder on earnings and high-frequency proxies.

**Earnings sensitivity:** With a buyback blackout window and valuation heat, prints/guidance matter more. Tech’s capex cycle (AI infrastructure) still underpins the medium-term story, yet near-term leadership is vulnerable to any hint of margin or supply-chain strain.

*   **Concentration risk cuts both ways.** When Tech isn’t carrying, the index struggles—today’s negative contribution from Info Tech plus weakness in cyclicals left the S&P in the red despite small defensive gains.
    
*   **Macro still supportive but not decisive.** A dovish-leaning Fed and contained long rates are tailwinds, yet a stronger dollar and stretched marks argue for **consolidation over reversal**.
    

*   **Bias:** Neutral-to-constructive medium term; tactically patient near term.
    
*   **Equity stance:** Respect the uptrend but **trim chase risk** in cyclicals; let earnings reset expectations.
    
*   **Pairs/overlays:** Prefer **quality/defensives vs. cyclicals** on days when USD↑ & UST10y↑. Keep AI-infrastructure exposure core but sized for volatility.
    
*   **What flips the script:** Softer labor + steady inflation → leadership can re-accelerate; a hawkish rates/FX impulse or margin squeeze would extend breadth deterioration.

IG spreads nudged a touch wider but stayed firmly in the carry channel. Bloomberg US IG OAS closed around **52.6 bp** (≈ +0.7 bp d/d) as a stronger dollar and a small backup in UST 10s to ~4.14% met still-dovish Fed rhetoric (Williams). The tone remains **sideways, carry-first**; dispersion > direction.

*   **IG OAS:** ~**52.6 bp**
    
*   **5-yr avg:** ~**62.4 bp** → ~**9.8 bp inside**
    
*   **Cycle tights:** **43.8 bp** → ~**8.8 bp off**
    
*   **Pandemic wides:** **151.8 bp** → ~**99 bp tighter**  
    _(Chart stats: Last ~52.6 | High 151.8 on 03/20/20 | Avg 62.37 | Low 43.75 on 02/13/20.)_
    

*   **< 60 bp**: Duration-friendly, carry-positive zone for insurers, pensions, and liability-driven buyers.
    
*   **60–70 bp**: Macro noise threshold, where volatility or inflation threats prompt positioning cuts.
    
*   **\> 90 bp**: Systemic stress unlikely unless global macro or geopolitical shocks return.
    

*   **Equities:** S&P −0.4%; leadership narrowed, cyclicals (Energy/Industrials/Materials) weak.
    
*   **Rates/FX:** UST10y ↑ to ~4.14%; **USD** at 10-week highs. Gold < $4,000; oil −1.7%.
    
*   **Fed:** Williams keeps an easing bias on the table if labor softens; minutes cautious but not hawkish.
    

*   **Carry > convexity:** Low-50s OAS keeps “clip the coupon” intact; no impulse for systemic widening.
    
*   **Duration cushion:** Long-end stability continues to attract A/AA long-duration demand.
    
*   **Dispersion watch:** Today’s cyclical equity weakness argues for **BBB cyclicals** (Energy/Industrials/Materials) to underperform on any further rates/FX headwind; single-name moves tied to guidance/M&A/capex.
    
*   **Correlation check:** USD↑ and UST10y↑ usually lean modestly wider; the move so far is **orderly**.
    

Base case remains a **sideways grind in the low-50s**: supportive policy path, contained rates, and robust demand for high-quality carry. Near-term risk is **breadth deterioration in cyclicals** plus a strong USD; offset is **Fed optionality** and steady duration demand.
