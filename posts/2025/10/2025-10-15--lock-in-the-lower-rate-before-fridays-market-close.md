Hey — quick heads up.

On Friday at market close, prices for Capital Flows move to $135/mo or $1,300/yr. If you upgrade BEFORE then, you’re grandfathered at $125/mo or $1,200/yr for as long as you stay active (if you already locked in your rate previously, it won’t change). This will be the last chance to get the Capital Flows Substack at the current price.

To reward action-takers, I’m adding two bonuses if you upgrade before the deadline:

*   Macro Regime Report: A breakdown of where we are now—what matters and how to analyze growth in light of government data being offline. (attached below)
    
*   The Risk Manual: The exact framework I use to take bets in markets and life. (attached below)
    

I’m constantly mapping all the changes across global markets that are taking place in real time. This is only going to get better! The world we are in with infinite leverage and AI is making HOW you think the most important thing about you. This is what the Capital Flows Substack is based on:

_**In the information age, you simply need to be at the right place, at the right time, with the right information to succeed**_

This is WHY I wrote all the educational primers, so you can build the proper foundation (for FREE): _**“You wasted $150,000 on an education you coulda got for $1.50 in late fees at the public library.”**_
