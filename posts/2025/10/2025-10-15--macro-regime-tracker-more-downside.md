_**The Macro Regime Tracker offers a daily lens on how shifts in growth, inflation, and liquidity affect short-term risk and reward. Leveraging machine learning, AI, and cross-asset data, it identifies macro changes and their impact on market positioning.**_

All of the macro views are linked here in the recent video I recorded for paid subscribers. The main question is, HOW MUCH risk is left in equities?

_**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_

Markets struggled to reconcile Fed reassurance with resurgent trade tension after President Trump’s remarks reignited friction with China. The S&P 500 clawed out a modest +0.83% gain, sustained by rotation into cyclicals and banks, but under the surface the mood turned fragile. Powell’s speech at the NABE conference affirmed an October rate cut and hinted that quantitative tightening could end soon, but traders were distracted as Trump threatened new restrictions on Chinese cooking-oil trade, pulling risk appetite back to neutral.

**Weighted Return Contribution (S&P +0.83%)**  
Leadership came from **Financials (+0.23%)**, **Industrials (+0.17%)**, and **Consumer Discretionary (+0.15%)**, together accounting for roughly two-thirds of the index’s move. Communication Services (+0.11%) added follow-through momentum, while Energy, Health Care, and Staples each chipped in modestly (~ +0.04–0.07%). Technology lagged slightly (–0.05%) as the AI trade paused for breath.

**Unweighted Performance (Breadth)**  
Breadth was surprisingly healthy despite the macro noise. **Industrials (+2.02%)** and **Financials (+1.68%)** topped the table, followed by **Materials (+1.63%)** and **Consumer Discretionary (+1.47%)**, underscoring rotation into real-economy cyclicals. **Energy (+1.27%)** and **Staples (+1.35%)** also advanced, hinting that investors remain anchored to quality earnings and pricing power. **Tech (–0.15%)** fell for a second session as talk of an AI bubble grew louder, reflecting fatigue rather than fundamental reversal.

**Catalyst & Tape:**  
The day began with optimism after Powell signaled that the Fed is firmly on track to deliver another quarter-point cut in October and may halt QT to preserve liquidity. Two-year yields hovered near 3.47%, their lowest since 2022, reinforcing the “policy-easing but data-dependent” narrative. Yet any dovish tailwind was blunted by renewed U.S.–China trade tension, reminding investors that geopolitical risk still trumps policy comfort.

**Rates & FX:**  
Treasuries flattened at the front end; the 10-year yield slipped to 4.02%. The dollar eased (–0.1%) as haven demand supported the yen (+0.4%) and euro (+0.3%). Markets continue to price ~125 bps of cumulative Fed cuts by end-2026 with a terminal near 3%.

**Commodities & Crypto:**  
Oil retraced (–1.7% WTI to $58.47) on concern that weaker global trade could sap demand, while gold rose (+0.8% to $4,144/oz) as traders sought protection against policy uncertainty. Bitcoin (–2.6%) and Ether (–4.1%) fell sharply, mirroring fading risk appetite in tech.

**Corporate & Credit:**  
Earnings season unofficially kicked off on a strong note, Goldman and Citi beat estimates across divisions, JPMorgan flagged credit vigilance but solid trading income, and Wells Fargo raised profitability guidance. BlackRock reported $205bn inflows as private-credit exposure expanded. Yet the AI theme wobbled: Citigroup’s CFO warned of “frothiness” in valuations, and AMD slipped after reports of a slower chip-order pipeline.

This was a rotation day, not a breakout. The index advance masked internal divergence: cyclicals outperformed as defensives and tech decoupled. Powell’s assurance of imminent cuts soothed rate fears, but Trump’s tariff rhetoric revived growth anxiety. a reminder that liquidity and policy support can’t fully offset political shocks. The AI trade looks stretched, while bank strength hints at stabilizing credit conditions. For now, markets are balancing between easing expectations and external risk; breadth says “risk is alive,” but leadership says “it’s tired.”

A fresh bout of U.S.–China tension knocked equities and oil, while haven bids supported gold and the front-end. Credit held its ground: IG OAS stayed pinned in the **low-to-mid-50s** as Powell reaffirmed an October cut and hinted QT may end soon, both supportive for liquidity and swap spreads. The message from spreads is “uneasy but intact carry.”

*   **IG OAS:** ~**53.4 bp**
    
*   **5-yr avg:** ~**62.4 bp** → ~**9 bp inside**
    
*   **Cycle tights:** **43.8 bp** → ~**9.6 bp above**
    
*   **Pandemic wides:** **151.8 bp** → ~**98 bp tighter**  
    _(Chart stats: Last ~53.37 | High 151.8 on 03/20/20 | Avg 62.36 | Low 43.75 on 02/13/20.)_
    

*   **<55–60 bp:** Carry-positive, duration-friendly zone for insurers/pensions; room to oscillate without breaking trend.
    
*   **60–70 bp:** Noise band where tariff or growth scares can push beta wider temporarily.
    
*   **\>90 bp:** Requires a genuine macro shock—still a low-probability tail given the policy backdrop.
    

*   **Equities:** Soft risk tone as tariff rhetoric re-emerged; AI leadership wobbled, banks resilient into earnings.
    
*   **Rates/FX:** 2y ~3.47% (cycle lows), 10y ~4.02%; easing expectations sticky (Oct cut priced, Dec likely). QT pause talk = supportive for spreads via funding/swap-spread channel.
    
*   **Commodities/Crypto:** WTI –1.7% (demand anxiety), gold +0.8% (hedging bid). Crypto heavy alongside tech fatigue.
    

*   **Beta:** With rates stable-to-softer and QT pause on the table, **base case is a grind within 50–60 bp**.
    
*   **Sector color:** Cyclical sleeves (Energy/Materials/Industrials) are **two-way** with tariff headlines; banks benefit from earnings clarity and a friendlier funding backdrop.
    
*   **Primary/flows:** Expect constructive reception for high-quality supply while volatility stays contained; liability-driven accounts keep clipping carry.
    

We shift from “holiday-quiet mid-50s” to “headline-tested but anchored”. Powell’s dovish tilt caps downside in credit even as trade noise caps upside. **Path of least resistance: 50–60 bp channel with a slight grind-tighter bias** if earnings stay constructive and tariff escalation cools. Upside risk to OAS (wider) is a sharp growth scare; downside (tighter) needs a clean risk tape plus a live rates bid.
