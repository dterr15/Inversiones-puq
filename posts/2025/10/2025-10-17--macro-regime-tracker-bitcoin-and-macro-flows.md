_**The Macro Regime Tracker offers a daily lens on how shifts in growth, inflation, and liquidity affect short-term risk and reward. Leveraging machine learning, AI, and cross-asset data, it identifies macro changes and their impact on market positioning.**_

I took an extended period of time in the livestream today explaining how to think about the macro picture, equities, gold, Bitcoin, and bonds. This video brings everything together:

The Bitcoin report I referenced in the video is here:

And Friday will be the last day to lock in the lower rate for the Substack before the price increase. I will be publishing some important pieces for paid subscribers tomorrow as well, so be on the lookout for this.

_**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_

The tape cracked as regional-bank stress returned to center stage and credit worries overwhelmed a steady Fed message. The S&P 500 fell −0.96%, a broad de-risking that pushed gold to fresh highs and pulled Treasury yields lower (10y ~4%, 2y making new cycle lows). With earnings unable to offset the macro overhang (tariffs, shutdown, AI froth), the path of least resistance was down, and most painfully for Financials.

Weighted Return Contribution (S&P −0.96%)  
Financials (−0.34%) was the single largest drag, eclipsing Tech (−0.14%). Discretionary (−0.12%), Communication Services (−0.09%), Industrials (−0.09%), and a cluster of defensives—Staples, Utilities, Health Care, Energy (each around −0.04%)—added steady bleed. Materials and Real Estate were marginal (each −0.01%). The message: this was a credit-led draw, not a pure growth/tech unwind.

Unweighted Performance (Breadth)  
Breadth was decisively risk-off. Financials (−2.56%) collapsed on renewed regional-bank concerns (bad-loan disclosures), with Utilities (−1.47%), Energy (−1.34%), Discretionary (−1.19%), Staples (−1.10%), Industrials (−1.05%), and Real Estate (−0.58%) all weak. Tech (−0.40%) and Materials (−0.40%) slipped but were not the epicenter. Communication Services (−0.87%) rounded out the broad deterioration. This is classic “credit scare → beta and yield-sensitives sell together.”

Catalyst mix: Headlines around bad loans at two regional lenders reignited fears about the health of U.S. credit just as shutdown risk and tariff noise linger. Asia is set to follow lower. Haven demand surged, gold to new records, while oil slipped to fresh five-month lows on rising de-escalation hopes around Russia supply.

Policy: The Fed tone stayed steady but split on dose. Governor Waller leaned into “careful cuts” (25 bp steps, watch the labor softening), while Miran argued for a larger move given tariff-driven downside risks. Markets still price a gradual easing path through 2026, but today’s price action said the growth/credit channel, not inflation, is steering risk.

Rates/FX: Bullish duration with curve rally led by the front end (labor cooling + credit nerves). The dollar eased as havens rotated to gold and JPY, but FX stayed orderly, this was about domestic credit first, global risk second.

This was a credit-led risk-off, not a simple cyclical wobble. Financials’ outsized weighted drag confirms the locus of stress; Utilities’ and Staples’ weakness alongside falling yields flags de-risking rather than a clean “defensive bid.” If the bank headlines remain contained, the damage stays tactical; if not, the equity-bond correlation flips back to “bad is bad.”

IG took the bank-scare headlines in stride. Despite equities rolling over (S&P −0.96% with Financials the heaviest hit), gold at fresh records and a front-end rates rally, cash IG stayed orderly and OAS held the familiar mid-50s channel. Tone = “risk wobbly, carry intact.”

Where We Sit (from the chart)

*   IG OAS: ~54.9 bp (last 54.87)
    
*   5-yr avg: ~61.9 bp → ~7 bp inside
    
*   Cycle tights: ~46.1 bp → ~8–9 bp above
    
*   2022 wides: ~111.2 bp → ~56 bp tighter
    

Tape & Macro Overlay

*   Catalyst mix: Regional-bank charge-off headlines reignited credit worries; Asia is set to open softer.
    
*   Policy: Waller keeps pushing “careful cuts” (25s, watch the softening labor market). Miran argues for a larger move given tariff-shock downside risk. The market still embeds a steady easing glide through ’26.
    
*   Rates/FX/Commodities: Bullish duration (2y to new cycle lows, 10y ~4%). DXY softer; JPY steadier. Gold makes new highs; oil sits near five-month lows on rising odds of freer Russian flows.
    

Mapping to IG

*   Base case: 50–60 bp range persists. Fed easing + potential QT flexibility cushion funding; tariff/geopolitics cap the upside for spreads.
    
*   Banks: The locus of equity stress, but senior IG remains supported by abundant term funding and a friendlier rates backdrop; watch for idiosyncratic widening, not systemic.
    
*   Cyclicals (Energy/Materials/Industrials): Two-way with oil and tariff tape; stay up-in-quality, duration neutral.
    
*   Defensives (Staples/HC/REIT IG): Rich but resilient; carry over capital gains unless rates rally accelerates.
    

Risk Markers to Watch

*   Regional-bank disclosures/charge-offs breadth (does it spread beyond a couple names?).
    
*   Front-end OIS vs. data vacuum from the shutdown (labor signals will steer the dose of cuts).
    
*   Gold ↑ / oil ↓ mix: clean credit hedge vs. creeping growth scare.
    

  
This was a credit-led equity drawdown day, but IG beta didn’t crack. As long as bank stress looks contained and the Fed stays in easing mode, IG OAS should remain range-bound with a slight grind-tighter bias inside 50–60 bp. A decisive break wider likely needs a genuine growth or funding shock; absent that, carry still does the work.
