_**The Macro Regime Tracker offers a daily lens on how shifts in growth, inflation, and liquidity affect short-term risk and reward. Leveraging machine learning, AI, and cross-asset data, it identifies macro changes and their impact on market positioning.**_

As we progress into FOMC, we are seeing confirmation of the views I laid out and the updated tensions around inflation risk from yesterday’s report:

_**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_

The tone flipped as solid prints from Corporate America and a cooling US-China temperature steadied risk. About 85% of reporters have beaten estimates, helping the S&P 500 add +1.1% on the day at the close of cash trading and log its best two-day run since June, with 10-year yields easing to ~3.98 bps and small caps outpacing. The bid was earnings-led, not multiple-led, and breadth improved meaningfully.

**Weighted Return Contribution (S&P +0.47%)**

*   **Leaders:** Financials **(+0.10%)**, Communication Services **(+0.10%)**, Information Tech **(+0.09%)**, Health Care **(+0.07%)**, Industrials **(+0.04%)**, Discretionary **(+0.05%)**.
    
*   **Tails:** Energy **(+0.02%)**, Materials **(+0.01%)**, Real Estate **(+0.01%)**; **Staples (−0.01%)**, **Utilities (−0.02%)**.  
    **Read:** The index advance was **broad and cyclically tilted**, with classic defensives (Staples, Utilities) subtracting at the margin, consistent with easing growth angst and lower rates.
    

**Unweighted Performance (Breadth)**

*   **Leaders:** Communication Services **(+0.99%)**, Financials **(+0.79%)**, Health Care **(+0.75%)**, Materials **(+0.65%)**, Real Estate **(+0.59%)**, Industrials **(+0.54%)**, Energy **(+0.55%)**, Discretionary **(+0.47%)**; Tech **(+0.24%)**.
    
*   **Laggards:** **Utilities (−0.80%)**, **Staples (−0.16%)**.  
    **Read:** **Broad participation** beyond megacap tech; beta and cyclicals outperformed while **bond-proxies lagged** despite softer yields, an earnings/animal-spirits day rather than a pure duration chase.
    

**Catalysts:**

*   Earnings season doing the heavy lifting (beat rate ~85%); Apple to fresh record on upgrade; small caps +1.9% as “profits-catch-up” narrative builds.
    
*   **US–China** tone a shade warmer (talks/meeting signals), even as tariff threats linger; traders faded worst-case escalation.
    
*   AWS outage headlines mostly idiosyncratic; didn’t dent the broader risk tone.
    

**Policy/Rates/FX:**

*   Front-to-back **yields drifted lower** (10y −3 bps to ~3.98%), easing the equity cost of capital; markets still lean to an **October 25 bp cut** with CPI (delayed by shutdown) now the week’s key macro print.
    
*   Dollar little changed; gold firmer on residual headline risk; crude flat.
    

*   **Earnings > Macro** (for now): when beats are this broad, the market will fund risk even with tariff chatter in the background.
    
*   **Cyclical breadth matters:** leadership from **Financials/Comm Services/Industrials/Materials/Real Estate** alongside negative **Utilities/Staples** says this was **growth/confidence**, not merely lower-rates.
    
*   **If** US-China de-escalation holds and big-tech guidance confirms AI spend → profitability, the path into year-end tilts higher; **watch** CPI for any services stickiness that could cap duration support.
    

*   **Megacap prints** (AI monetization, capex efficiency).
    
*   **CPI (Fri):** a 0.3% core keeps the soft-landing glide path; hotter would re-tighten financial conditions.
    
*   **Breadth follow-through:** do Financials and Comm Services keep leading while defensives lag? That’s your tell that this rebound is **earnings-driven and durable**, not just a relief rally.

IG tightened with the risk tone. As equities rebounded (S&P +1.1%, small caps +1.9%) on strong beats and a warmer US-China temperature, credit spreads **ground into the low-50s** and stayed orderly with yields a touch softer (10y ~3.98%). Tone = “earnings-led risk-on, carry still king.”

*   **IG OAS:** ~**52.2 bp** (last 52.16)
    
*   **5-yr avg:** ~**61.9 bp** → ~**10 bp inside**
    
*   **Cycle tights:** ~**46.1 bp** → ~**6 bp above**
    
*   **2022 wides:** ~**111.2 bp** → ~**59 bp tighter**
    

**Catalysts:** Beat rate near ~85% has investors rewarding cyclicals and beta; tariff rhetoric persists but talks/meetings signal de-escalation risk.  
**Policy:** Market still leans to an **Oct 25 bp cut**; CPI (Fri) is the swing print for dose and path.  
**Rates/FX/Commodities:** Mild bull-steepening bias with 10y −3 bp; USD little changed; gold firmer on headline hedging; crude flat.

*   **Base case:** **50–60 bp** range remains the center of gravity with a **grind-tighter bias** while earnings surprise positive and policy glides toward easing.
    
*   **Banks:** Equity nerves faded; **senior IG stable** on ample term funding and easier rates. Watch idiosyncratic names, not the beta.
    
*   **Cyclicals (Energy/Materials/Industrials):** Two-way to tariffs/oil, but the earnings tone helps **quality BBB/A** compress modestly.
    
*   **Defensives (Staples/HC/REIT IG):** Rich and steady; carry dominates unless duration rally accelerates.
    
*   **Tech/Comms:** Headlines (cloud outages, AI monetization) are **idiosyncratic**, no systemic read to IG; large-cap balance sheets still a support.
    

*   **CPI core (0.3% m/m consensus):** hot print risks a brief rates tantrum → pause the grind; in-line keeps carry bid intact.
    
*   **US-China tape:** de-escalation keeps beta open; renewed tariff shock would cap spread tightening.
    
*   **Regional-bank disclosures:** breadth of charge-offs still the canary; systemic signal would be a clean break back **above ~60 bp**.
    

With earnings doing the heavy lifting and policy bias easing, **IG OAS compresses toward cycle tights but respects the 50–60 bp corral**. Absent a growth or funding shock, **carry does the work**; fade breaks wider without corroborating macro stress.
