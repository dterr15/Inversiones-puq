_**The Macro Regime Tracker offers a daily lens on how shifts in growth, inflation, and liquidity affect short-term risk and reward. Leveraging machine learning, AI, and cross-asset data, it identifies macro changes and their impact on market positioning.**_

My view on equities has not changed. My equity strategy remains long and the warning signals are NOT flashing neutral or bearish, YET.

The key thing to remember is that during this period of time, we are seeing interest rates remain stable. The decrease in inflation risk has allowed more cuts to be priced without causing risk to the long end of the curve. I laid out the logic for this and how it impacts the cycle in the recent report.

As always, all the systematic models and strategies are laid out below. Thanks

_**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_

Wall Street lost traction overnight as the post-rally fatigue turned into a broad de-risking. The S&P 500 slipped −0.5%, with Tech and Industrials leading the retreat while Energy was the lone standout. The move was part of a wider cross-asset shakeout as momentum-heavy names AI, crypto, and precious metals were hit again. A mix of weaker earnings tone (Netflix, Tesla), renewed US-China tension on export curbs, and sanction-driven oil strength as reasons for the rotation.

**Weighted Return Contribution (S&P −0.50%)**  
Leaders: Energy (+0.02%), Staples (+0.03%).  
Drags: Info Tech (−0.25%), Industrials (−0.13%), Financials (−0.09%), Discretionary (−0.07%), Comm Services (−0.02%), Utilities (−0.01%); Materials and Health Care flat.

**Unweighted Performance (Breadth)**  
Leaders: Energy (+0.81%), Staples (+0.59%), Real Estate (+0.14%).  
Laggards: Industrials (−1.63%), Financials (−0.65%), Info Tech (−0.70%), Discretionary (−0.64%), Utilities (−0.44%), Comm Services (−0.25%).

**Read:** The index fell on concentration risk, Tech and Industrials weighed most while Energy’s oil-linked rebound offered limited offset. Breadth skewed sharply negative, revealing profit-taking across growth and momentum pockets, particularly AI and semis.

**Catalysts / Tape Feel**  
The risk unwind followed a cluster of catalysts: US sanctions on Russian oil majors lifted crude ~2%, Tesla’s earnings miss dampened animal spirits, and talk of potential export curbs to China revived trade anxiety. Retail momentum and AI-linked names extended their drawdown, echoing the “music-stopped” feel noted by Bespoke.

**Policy / Rates / FX**  
Treasuries were steady (10-yr 3.95%, −1 bp) with a firm $13 bn 20-yr auction signaling healthy demand. The Fed narrative turned political as Governor Waller’s measured quarter-point vote reinforced independence amid Trump pressure for deeper cuts. The USD held firm; gold pared losses after an intraday −2.9% swing.

**Cross-Asset Pulse**  
Oil +2% (WTI ~$60) on sanctions headlines. Gold and crypto slipped as liquidity rotated back to the USD. Momentum baskets especially AI, metals, and beta proxies saw further liquidation, tightening overall financial conditions at the margin.

*   **De-risking, not panic:** Losses clustered in high-beta, high-valuation sectors while defensives stabilized, classic “risk fatigue” rather than fundamental stress.
    
*   **Energy lone bright spot:** Crude’s rally turned Energy into the day’s ballast; cyclical correlation flipped.
    
*   **Fed independence theme:** Waller’s stance and chatter of Bessent’s shortlist framed the Fed’s credibility as the next macro debate.
    
*   **Rotation check:** Momentum unwinds are widening beyond AI, watch if Staples/Real Estate follow-through to confirm a defensive tilt.
    

*   **CPI (Friday):** Core 0.3% keeps the soft-landing script intact; 0.4–0.5% risks reigniting the USD and pressuring duration.
    
*   **Breadth test:** Does Energy leadership broaden or stay isolated while Tech/Industrials lag?
    
*   **Fed politics:** Follow Waller and Bessent commentary for hints on institutional independence vs. Trump influence.
    
*   **Oil vs. Growth:** If crude sustains above $60 while demand data softens, inflation-vs-growth trade-offs may re-price quickly.

IG spreads stayed resilient as equities wobbled and crude jumped on fresh Russia sanctions. With 10-yr USTs essentially unchanged (~3.95%) and a solid 20-yr auction, OAS is still camped in the low-50s, textbook carry behavior despite noisier headlines around tech earnings, China export-curb chatter, and the momentum unwind in AI/crypto/metals.

*   **IG OAS:** ~**53.0 bp** (last 53.05)
    
*   **5-yr avg:** ~**61.9 bp** → ~**9 bp inside**
    
*   **Cycle tights:** ~**46.1 bp** → ~**7 bp above**
    
*   **2022 wides:** ~**111.2 bp** → ~**58 bp tighter**
    

Read: We’re mid-channel between cycle tights and the 5-yr mean, comfortably “normal,” not stretched.

*   **Equities:** Broad risk-off day (S&P −0.5%); Tech/Industrials led the drag while Energy outperformed on oil strength. Momentum baskets have been bleeding for days, classic de-risking, not disorderly.
    
*   **Rates/FX:** 10s steady; $13bn 20-yr sale came through well. USD mixed; **gold** swung hard intraday again.
    
*   **Commodities:** **WTI ~+2%** (≈$60) on sanctions headlines; distillate/gasoline draws add to the bid.
    
*   **Policy:** Fed politics in focus, **Waller** reaffirmed the incremental/cuts-but-independent stance; regulators are exploring a **softer bank-capital** path, marginally constructive for IG financials.
    
*   **China/Trade:** Talk of **software-export curbs** keeps a lid on animal spirits but hasn’t migrated into credit risk premia.
    

*   **Base case:** The **50–60 bp corral** remains the center of gravity. With rates contained and funding windows open, **grind-tighter bias** persists toward high-40s only if macro stays calm and oil doesn’t morph into an inflation scare.
    
*   **Financials:** Senior paper steady to a touch better, capital-rule relaxation chatter offsets equity volatility. Supply windows remain healthy.
    
*   **Cyclicals (Energy/Materials/Industrials):** Oil pop helps Energy credits; broader cyclicals are two-way with tariff/export-curb noise, but high-quality BBB/A **compression continues**.
    
*   **Defensives (Staples/HC/REIT IG):** Rich but stable; carry dominates unless we get a sharp duration rally.
    
*   **Tech/Comms:** Equity noise (guidance/misses) hasn’t translated into spread stress for mega-cap balance sheets.
    

*   **CPI (Fri):** **0.3% core** = carry on; **0.4–0.5%** risks a brief rates tantrum and stalls further tightening.
    
*   **Oil path:** Sustained move >$60 with draws would nudge breakevens up and could cheapen beta sleeves.
    
*   **Fed personnel/politics:** Waller vs. “bigger cuts” pressure and independence headlines matter for term premium, not today’s OAS.
    
*   **China export-curb escalation:** A headline shock could widen **Tech/Comms** secondaries and cap the grind.
    
*   **Regional-bank updates:** A clean break **back above ~60 bp** would be the early systemic tell.
    

Despite equity chop and sanction-driven oil, IG remains in **carry mode**. Absent a hot CPI or policy shock, OAS should **hug the low-50s** and **grind**, with any risk-off widening likely shallow and fleeting.
