_**The Macro Regime Tracker offers a daily lens on how shifts in growth, inflation, and liquidity affect short-term risk and reward. Leveraging machine learning, AI, and cross-asset data, it identifies macro changes and their impact on market positioning.**_

I laid out the main macro bets I am taking right now here:

_**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_

Wall Street shook off the recent wobble and pushed higher into the CPI print, led once again by Big Tech and cyclical pockets. The S&P 500 rose +0.51%, approaching its all-time highs as hopes of de-escalation in US-China trade tensions boosted risk sentiment. President Trump confirmed he’ll meet Xi Jinping on Oct 30, while oil surged on fresh sanctions against Russian producers, a reminder that the inflation fight isn’t over. Bonds sold off modestly (10-yr +6 bp to 4.00%) as traders priced in another Fed cut next week despite lingering price pressures.

**Weighted Return Contribution (S&P +0.51%)**  
Leaders: Info Tech (+0.34%), Discretionary (+0.18%), Industrials (+0.07%), Health Care (+0.03%).  
Drags: Comm Services (−0.05%), Staples (−0.02%), Utilities (−0.02%); Energy and Financials flat.

**Unweighted Performance (Breadth)**  
Leaders: Discretionary (+1.69%), Info Tech (+0.97%), Industrials (+0.90%), Materials (+0.43%), Health Care (+0.28%).  
Laggards: Utilities (−0.74%), Comm Services (−0.51%), Staples (−0.37%), Real Estate (−0.24%).

**Read:** Momentum and cyclicals drove the tape — Tech, Industrials, and Discretionary carried the load while defensives were unwound. The index advance was broad enough to offset small-cap softness and commodity volatility, suggesting positioning clean-up rather than fresh risk aversion.

**Catalysts / Tape Feel**  
The mood brightened as trade diplomacy headlines broke — confirmation of a Trump-Xi meeting and early signs of thaw in US-China tensions. The quantum-computing “arms race” narrative added to optimism in AI-linked names. Oil’s +5% spike on Russian sanctions sparked a fleeting inflation scare but failed to derail the risk bid; investors leaned into cyclical growth themes ahead of CPI.

**Policy / Rates / FX**  
Treasuries softened with 10-yr yields touching 4.00% and 2-yr +5 bp to 3.49%. Markets still price two Fed cuts this year (Oct + Dec), with inflation seen as a bump not a barrier. The USD held firm while gold stabilized and crypto extended gains. The easing bias narrative remains intact, but higher oil clouds the timing of additional rate cuts.

**Cross-Asset Pulse**  
Oil +5.4% (WTI ≈ $61.6), Gold +0.5%, Bitcoin +2.3%, Ether +1.9%. The rotation back into energy and AI shows traders are comfortable fading last week’s de-risking — at least until CPI confirms that the inflation impulse is contained.

**Re-risking ahead of CPI:** Traders stepped back into Tech and Discretionary leadership on optimism over Fed easing and trade progress.  
**Energy & inflation risk:** Crude’s spike adds short-term inflation risk, but the market’s calm response shows confidence the Fed will look through it.  
**Defensives under pressure:** Staples, Utilities, and Comm Services lagged as yields rose and duration proxies lost appeal.  
**Momentum rebuild:** Breadth improved, suggesting last week’s correction may have reset positioning rather than ended the cycle.

*   **CPI (Friday):** Core 0.3% keeps the soft-landing script alive; 0.4% or higher revives “higher for longer” fears.
    
*   **Fed path:** Focus shifts to how the Fed communicates easing under political pressure, Bessent/Waller commentary in view.
    
*   **Oil vs Equities:** If crude holds > $60, watch for renewed inflation-hedge flows into Energy vs. Tech rotation.
    
*   **China Trade Tone:** Any follow-through from the Trump-Xi meeting could anchor risk sentiment into month-end.

IG spreads held firm as equities rallied, oil spiked on Russia sanctions, and rates cheapened ahead of CPI. Despite the macro noise, the index OAS remains classic carry, anchored in the low-50s and refusing to chase cross-asset volatility.

*   **IG OAS:** **~52.1 bp** (last 52.08)
    
*   **5-yr avg:** **~61.9 bp** → ~10 bp inside
    
*   **Cycle tights:** **~46.1 bp** → ~6 bp above
    
*   **2022 wides:** **~111.2 bp** → ~59 bp tighter
    

**Read:** Still mid-channel between cycle tights and the 5-yr mean—comfortably “normal,” not stretched.

*   **Equities:** Risk appetite rebuilt (S&P +0.6%) on cooling US-China tension and confirmation of a **Trump–Xi** meeting; Big Tech led.
    
*   **Rates/FX:** USTs sold off modestly (**10-yr ~4.00%, +6 bp; 2-yr ~3.49%, +5 bp**). USD steady; gold stabilized.
    
*   **Commodities:** **WTI +5.4% (~$61.6)** on sanction headlines; inflation optics worsened but didn’t dent credit.
    
*   **Policy:** Market still leans toward **two Fed cuts this year (Oct & Dec)**; CPI Friday is the near-term arbiter.
    
*   **Positioning feel:** Vol spikes are being faded; drawdowns treated as add-risk windows, constructive for primary and secondaries.
    

*   **Base case:** The **50–60 bp** corral remains the center of gravity. A calm CPI keeps the **grind-tighter** bias toward high-40s; a hot print likely just pauses the grind rather than triggers disorder.
    
*   **Financials:** Senior hold firm; friendlier capital-rules chatter offsets the rate backup. Supply windows open, new issues well-absorbed.
    
*   **Cyclicals (Energy/Materials/Industrials):** Oil pop is **credit-positive** for Energy; broader cyclicals two-way with tariff/export-tech noise, but **BBB/A compression** persists.
    
*   **Defensives (Staples/HC/REIT IG):** Rich but stable carry dominates unless rates rally hard.
    
*   **Tech/Comms:** Equity headlines noisy, balance-sheet strength keeps **spreads insulated**.
    

*   **CPI (Fri):** **Core 0.3% = carry on.** **0.4–0.5%** risks a brief rates tantrum and stalls tightening momentum.
    
*   **Oil path:** Sustained **\>$60** with product draws nudges breakevens up; watch beta sleeves for any cheapening.
    
*   **China/trade tone:** Follow-through on Trump–Xi could underpin risk and reopen Asia-linked issuance.
    
*   **Regional-bank vibe:** A decisive break **back above ~60 bp** OAS would be the early systemic tell, low probability near term.
    

Even with stocks higher, oil spiking, and yields up, **US IG is still in carry mode**. Barring a hot CPI or policy shock, expect OAS to **hug the low-50s and grind**, with any risk-off widening **shallow and fadeable**.
