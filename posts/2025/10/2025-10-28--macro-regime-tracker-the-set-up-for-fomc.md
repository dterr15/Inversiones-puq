_**The Macro Regime Tracker offers a daily lens on how shifts in growth, inflation, and liquidity affect short-term risk and reward. Leveraging machine learning, AI, and cross-asset data, it identifies macro changes and their impact on market positioning.**_

I have laid out the macro views for the cycle and the short end in the following reports:

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* UPDATED CODE TO BE RUN TOMORROW \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

_**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_

Risk stayed constructive with the S&P 500 up **+0.32%**. The tone was buoyed by continued **US-China trade de-escalation** headlines and a supportive earnings backdrop, while rate markets were calm and liquidity healthy into a heavy megacap results week.

**Weighted Return Contribution (Index +0.32%)**  
Leaders: **Info Tech (+0.18%)**, **Comm Services (+0.06%)**, **Discretionary (+0.04%)**, **Health Care (+0.03%)**, Industrials (+0.01%), Real Estate (+0.01%), Utilities (+0.01%)  
Drags: **Staples (−0.01%)**, Materials (≈−0.00%), Energy (≈−0.00%); Financials flat

**Unweighted Performance (Breadth)**  
Leaders: **Comm Services (+0.56%)**, **Utilities (+0.50%)**, **Info Tech (+0.51%)**, **Discretionary (+0.38%)**, **Health Care (+0.29%)**, **Real Estate (+0.29%)**, Industrials (+0.08%)  
Laggards: **Staples (−0.26%)**, **Energy (−0.15%)**, **Materials (−0.14%)**

**Read:** Participation broadened beyond megacaps. Tech and Comm Services stayed in charge on AI/data-center momentum, while Utilities and Health Care caught a steady-rates bid. Weakness in Staples/Energy/Materials looked like rotation, not stress.

**Tape & Catalysts**

*   **Trade thaw:** Negotiators lined up deliverables for a **Trump–Xi summit**, keeping risk appetite intact and supporting US-listed China proxies.
    
*   **Earnings in focus:** With **MSFT, GOOGL, META, AMZN, AAPL** reporting mid-week, the market is leaning on resilient profit stories; sales beats are running strong.
    
*   **Rates/FX:** **2-yr auction** cleared essentially on-the-screws (~**3.50%**) with solid indirect participation, signaling steady foreign demand. The **USD was little changed**; **gold steadied** after slipping below $4,000; **crypto mixed**.
    
*   **Global tone:** Asia mixed after **Nikkei > 50,000**; Australia softer. Oil was little changed near the low-60s.
    

*   **Re-risking via earnings + diplomacy:** Equities are digesting macro noise as trade headlines improve and profit momentum holds.
    
*   **Quality + duration mix:** Tech leadership persists, but Utilities/Health Care participation hints at a balanced “growth plus carry” bid.
    
*   **No rates shock:** Calm auctions and contained yields keep the equity multiple supported.
    

*   **Megacap prints & guides:** Do AI capex and cloud run-rates validate Tech’s leadership?
    
*   **Trade optics:** Any concrete deliverables from the Trump–Xi track that sustain the risk bid.
    
*   **Rotation durability:** Whether Utilities/Health Care outperformance extends (maturing momentum) or flips back to pure cyclicals.
    

**Bottom line:** A calm, earnings-led grind higher with trade diplomacy as a tailwind and rates cooperation keeping the runway clear.

Investment-grade credit stayed resilient even as equities pushed to new highs and oil held near $60. The index option-adjusted spread remains **locked around 50 bp**, well inside the five-year average (~61.9 bp) and still roughly **6 bp above cycle tights (~46 bp)**. Despite sharp moves in equities and commodities, credit markets continue to signal a stable, low-vol environment, classic **carry conditions** rather than stress or exuberance.

*   **IG OAS:** ~50.2 bp (last 50.22)
    
*   **5-yr avg:** ~61.9 bp → ~12 bp inside
    
*   **Cycle tights:** ~46.1 bp → ~4 bp above
    
*   **2022 wides:** ~111.2 bp → ~61 bp tighter
    

**Read:** The OAS remains mid-range, comfortably normalized and anchored. The spread market refuses to chase the equity rally or flinch at cross-asset volatility, reflecting confidence in liquidity, fundamentals, and a benign policy path.

**Equities:**  
The S&P 500 added +0.32%, extending record territory as **US–China trade diplomacy** and a solid corporate earnings slate buoyed sentiment. Breadth improved, with Tech, Communication Services, and Health Care leading.

**Rates/FX:**  
USTs were little changed (10-yr ~4.00%, 2-yr ~3.50%), maintaining curve stability after last week’s auctions. The **USD held steady**, and **gold** hovered near $4,000 after its sharp correction.

**Commodities:**  
**Oil (~$61)** remains subdued after last week’s spike, helping stabilize inflation optics. Energy equities traded mixed, but credit spreads in the sector remain firm.

**Global tone:**  
Asian equities mixed following Japan’s milestone **Nikkei 50,000** print; European data (IFO, M3) show steady if subdued growth. Trade-related headlines remain the key swing factor for cross-asset tone.

**Base case:** The **50–55 bp zone** is still home base, fair value in a low-vol, liquidity-rich market.  
**Bias:** Modestly tighter toward **high-40s** if trade momentum endures and earnings confirm macro resilience.

**Financials:**  
Senior bank paper holds firm, aided by steady issuance absorption and confidence in regulatory flexibility.

**Cyclicals (Energy, Materials, Industrials):**  
Credit impact muted; oil stability keeps Energy carry intact, while tariff headlines drive only marginal idiosyncratic movement.

**Defensives (Staples, Health Care, REITs):**  
Still rich but well-supported by flows, duration stability keeps these sleeves attractive.

**Tech/Comms:**  
Earnings in focus this week (MSFT, GOOGL, META, AMZN, AAPL). Balance sheets remain fortress-like; minimal spread beta to equity volatility.

*   **Trade tone:** Any concrete progress from the **Trump–Xi** track anchors the risk tone through month-end.
    
*   **Oil path:** Sustained >$60 brings marginal widening pressure in cyclicals but little systemic impact.
    
*   **Equity follow-through:** A melt-up without credit confirmation would flag late-cycle exuberance, but we’re not there yet.
    
*   **Systemic tell:** Watch 60 bp OAS, only a decisive break above signals a regime shift, still a low-probability tail.
    

Credit remains calm, carry-focused, and orderly. With equities setting records and macro risks contained, **US IG spreads remain comfortably rangebound**, a picture of stability amid optimism. Until the trade narrative breaks or oil reawakens inflation fears, expect OAS to **hover near 50 bp** and grind tighter on dips.
