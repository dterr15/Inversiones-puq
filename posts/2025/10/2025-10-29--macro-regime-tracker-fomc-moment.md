_**The Macro Regime Tracker offers a daily lens on how shifts in growth, inflation, and liquidity affect short-term risk and reward. Leveraging machine learning, AI, and cross-asset data, it identifies macro changes and their impact on market positioning.**_

The macro regime continues to show strength as equities melt up. This is the theme I have consistently laid out since April. The recent video I did on the credit cycle explained that the Fed is cutting rates into accelerating growth.

As the Fed cuts rates into grwoth, we are seeing the Mag7 names get A TON of capital as market breadth is fairly neutral. In simple terms, the rally in the S&P500 is being driven by Mag7 while everything else just sits there. The macro clearing event tomorrow could cause some short term selling pressure, but this would be another buying opportunity in my view.

_**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_

Markets traded sideways into Wednesday’s Fed decision and a critical stretch of megacap tech earnings. The S&P 500 ended marginally lower (−0.02%), masking a sharp dispersion beneath the surface: Tech strength kept the tape afloat, while defensives and interest-sensitive sectors extended declines. Liquidity stayed ample and rates were contained, but breadth deteriorated again, nearly 400 stocks fell on the day.

**Weighted Return Contribution (Index −0.02%)**  
Leaders: Info Tech (+0.23%), Cons Discretionary (+0.05%), Materials (+0.01%)  
Drags: Financials (−0.09%), Health Care (−0.05%), Industrials (−0.06%), Real Estate (−0.03%), Comm Services (−0.04%), Utilities (−0.04%), Staples (−0.02%), Energy (−0.02%)

**Unweighted Performance (Breadth)**  
Leaders: Info Tech (+0.65%), Materials (+0.63%), Cons Discretionary (+0.47%)  
Laggards: Utilities (−1.53%), Real Estate (−1.39%), Industrials (−0.80%), Energy (−0.68%), Financials (−0.68%), Health Care (−0.61%), Staples (−0.46%), Comm Services (−0.41%)

The index stayed near record highs thanks entirely to Tech’s +0.23 pp contribution, masking broad underperformance elsewhere. Weakness clustered in rate-sensitive groups (Utilities, REITs, Financials) as investors trimmed duration exposure ahead of the FOMC. Cyclicals like Materials and Discretionary held up modestly, consistent with resilient growth expectations.

**Fed and Policy Context**  
The market is marking time before Wednesday’s expected quarter-point rate cut. Futures imply high confidence in the move but little clarity on the guidance, most expect Powell to keep optionality open on ending quantitative tightening. A calm front end and contained term premium continue to support valuations, but the weaker sector breadth shows some unease about follow-through beyond Tech.

**AI & Earnings Focus**  
Five megacaps; MSFT, GOOGL, META, AMZN, AAPL all report within 48 hours. Nvidia’s +5% gain and suppliers’ blowout prints (SK Hynix +4%, Advantest +20%) reinforced the “AI-supercycle” theme, while expectations remain elevated: the Magnificent 7 are projected to post +14% profit growth versus +8% for the broader S&P. The test now is whether guidance sustains that gap.

**Macro Backdrop**  
Consumer confidence fell for a third month (Conference Board 94.6), underscoring a softer household outlook even as spending stays firm. Oil held near $60 and gold bounced modestly, while the USD drifted lower for a third session. The 10-yr yield was steady at 3.98%. Trump’s Asia trip, featuring talk of tariff relief and a prospective US-China tech-cooperation deal, added a mild geopolitical tailwind.

**1\. Narrow leadership:** The rally’s dependency on Tech is deepening, breadth deterioration despite record-high prints signals fragility beneath the index.  
**2\. Rates pause helps valuation, not participation:** Stable yields are supporting multiples, but rate-sensitive sectors remain sellers’ territory.  
**3\. Growth narrative intact:** Cyclicals’ relative resilience and commodity stability suggest no sharp downgrade to the macro growth view yet.

*   **FOMC tone:** Whether Powell signals a pause in QT or a dovish bias beyond this cut.
    
*   **Megacap guidance:** Cloud, AI-infrastructure, and capex commentary, do they validate current leadership?
    
*   **Breadth check:** Does participation rebound if the Fed confirms a soft-landing stance?
    

A flat index that hides a hollow advance, Tech’s strength offset broad sector weakness. Markets are holding steady into the dual catalysts of Fed guidance and Big Tech earnings. The next move hinges on whether policy reassurance and profit momentum can reignite breadth or whether leadership concentration tightens further.

Investment-grade credit remains locked in a remarkably tight range, with the Bloomberg US IG OAS holding near **50.7 bp**, barely changed on the week. The stability underscores just how anchored credit risk has become in a market balancing strong liquidity, contained volatility, and an improving macro narrative into the Fed’s expected quarter-point rate cut.

*   **IG OAS:** ~50.7 bp (last 50.74)
    
*   **5-yr avg:** ~61.9 bp → ~11 bp inside
    
*   **Cycle tights:** ~46.1 bp → ~4–5 bp above
    
*   **2022 wides:** ~111.2 bp → ~60 bp tighter
    

The OAS sits comfortably in its lower quartile of the 5-year range, reflecting normalized liquidity and well-anchored risk appetite. Despite cross-asset rotation under the surface, rate-sensitives soft, Tech still dominant, credit spreads show zero sign of strain. Carry remains the defining theme: slow grind, low vol, and asymmetric upside to holding risk.

**Fed and Macro:**  
Markets are coiled ahead of Wednesday’s FOMC, where a **25 bp rate cut** is fully priced. The debate has shifted to guidance, whether Powell hints at an end to quantitative tightening. A dovish-leaning communication would reinforce the current “liquidity cushion” narrative, key to maintaining tight credit spreads.

**Equities:**  
The S&P 500 closed −0.02%, masking weak breadth as rate-sensitives (Utilities, REITs, Financials) lagged while Tech stayed strong. The leadership concentration in megacaps hasn’t disturbed credit yet; balance-sheet quality in those names keeps IG confidence high.

**Rates/FX:**  
The 10-yr UST yield held near **3.98%**, with the front end steady (~3.50%), preserving the curve’s shallow slope. Dollar drifted modestly lower for a third session, and gold regained footing after a three-day pullback.

**Commodities:**  
WTI around **$60** after a three-day slide; stable energy prices remove inflation anxiety and support the Fed’s latitude to cut. Oil’s round-trip from mid-60s to low-60s helped Energy credit remain resilient, no sectoral spread contagion.

**Global Tone:**  
Asia firmed on AI optimism ahead of megacap earnings (MSFT, GOOGL, META, AMZN, AAPL). Trump’s Asia tour, including tariff-reduction hints and US-China tech cooperation headlines, further underpinned the global risk tone.

Fair value remains **50–55 bp**, representing “carry equilibrium.” Absent a rates shock or policy misstep, the 40s remain a plausible target range by year-end.

*   **Fed tone:** A cut without QT clarity could nudge spreads wider, but liquidity remains abundant.
    
*   **Oil path:** Sustained <$60 could tighten Energy spreads; a sharp reversal above $70 might test cyclicals.
    
*   **Equity breadth:** Continued narrow leadership without stress in credit = late-cycle melt-up, not fragility.
    
*   **Systemic tell:** Only a decisive break above **60 bp OAS** would flag a regime shift; still a low-probability tail.
    

Credit’s calm persists, spreads are steady, carry is king, and liquidity is ample.  
Even as equities wobble under sector rotation and macro data show mild consumer fatigue, US IG remains the anchor of cross-asset stability. With the Fed expected to reinforce a patient, liquidity-friendly stance, expect OAS to hover near **50 bp** and grind tighter on dips, a quiet affirmation that the credit market still believes in the soft-landing narrative.
