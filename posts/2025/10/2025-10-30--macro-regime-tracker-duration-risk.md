_**The Macro Regime Tracker offers a daily lens on how shifts in growth, inflation, and liquidity affect short-term risk and reward. Leveraging machine learning, AI, and cross-asset data, it identifies macro changes and their impact on market positioning.**_

I spent time breaking down the macro watchlist I use, and you can download it for free here:

_**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_

A tech-led pullback and a firmer dollar knocked the index lower as the Fed’s tone nudged the market toward a slower easing path. AI-capex headlines (Meta) hit leadership, while defensives were mixed and rate-sensitives only partially cushioned the tape.

**Weighted return contribution (Index −0.46 pp)**

*   **Drags:** **Info Tech −0.33 pp**, **Comm Svcs −0.10 pp**, **Cons Disc −0.09 pp**, **Energy −0.02 pp**
    
*   **Offsets:** **Financials +0.02 pp**, **Real Estate +0.01 pp**, **Staples +0.01 pp**
    
*   Others ≈ flat to −0.01 pp (Health Care, Industrials, Materials, Utilities)
    

**Unweighted performance (breadth)**

*   **Laggards:** **Comm Svcs −1.02%**, **Cons Disc −0.92%**, **Info Tech −0.91%**, **Materials −0.31%**, **Energy −0.59%**, **Utilities −0.48%**, **Industrials −0.07%**
    
*   **Leaders:** **Real Estate +0.56%**, **Financials +0.19%**, **Staples +0.13%**, **Health Care −0.03%**
    

The index decline was overwhelmingly a **mega-cap Tech/Comm/Discretionary** story. Breadth was negative, but REITs/Staples/Financials posted modest gains, consistent with stable rates and a mild quality bid, too small to offset Tech’s drag.

*   **Policy/Rates:** Powell’s messaging trimmed near-term cut odds; 10y ~4.09%, 2y ~3.61%. The guidance implies **slower, not smaller**, easing, supportive for credit, neutral-to-headwind for long-duration equities.
    
*   **FX/Commodities:** **USD at a 3-month high**; **WTI ~$60** (soft), helping keep inflation anxiety muted.
    
*   **Earnings/AI:** Capex escalation across Big Tech is testing risk appetite near stretched valuations; flow into AI remains thematic, but leadership concentration raises fragility.
    

1.  **Leadership risk resurfaced:** When Tech stumbles, the index follows, today’s −0.46% came with **−0.33 pp from Info Tech alone** and further drag from Comm/Disc.
    
2.  **No stress signal from cyclicals/credit:** REITs and Financials green on the day and IG spreads steady suggest **liquidity remains ample**; this is **rotation/de-risking**, not a funding event.
    
3.  **Macro still Goldilocks-tilted, but narrower:** Growth resilient, inflation contained, liquidity OK, yet **USD strength + tech capex angst** compress participation.
    

*   **Fed speak:** Any step toward a December “skip”.
    
*   **Megacap guidance durability:** Cloud/AI monetization vs capex burn, does margin math improve?
    
*   **Breadth repair:** Can Financials/Staples/REITs leadership broaden to Industrials/Materials, or does weakness rotate back into small caps?
    

The tape is **pausing, not breaking**. With policy gliding toward **slow-motion normalization** and rate vol contained, the path of least resistance is **range-bound with factor churn**. Until breadth repairs, the index remains **tactically vulnerable to additional mega-cap headlines**, but systemic signals (rates, credit, oil) still point to a **soft-landing baseline**.

US IG credit stayed calm despite a wobble in mega-cap tech and a firmer dollar. The Bloomberg US IG OAS prints ~52.1 bp, little changed, and remains in the lower quartile of its five-year range. The tape continues to say “carry first, volatility later”: funding is ample, defaults contained, and macro uncertainty is being absorbed without spread stress.

*   **IG OAS:** ~**52.1 bp** (last 52.07)
    
*   **5-yr average:** ~**61.9 bp** → ~**10 bp inside**
    
*   **Cycle tights:** ~**46.1 bp** → ~**6 bp above**
    
*   **2022 wides:** ~**111.2 bp** → ~**59 bp tighter**
    

Spreads remain comfortably inside the five-year mean and still within touching distance of the cycle tights. That positioning is consistent with normalized liquidity, compression in idiosyncratic risk premia, and a market willing to clip carry while waiting out policy clarity.

*   **Fed/Policy:** The Fed’s tone trimmed near-term cut odds and nudged the dollar higher, but the guidance didn’t introduce a credit-negative shock. Slower, not smaller, easing remains the message, which IG can live with.
    
*   **Equities:** A −1% S&P day led by AI capex angst (Meta) hit breadth but not credit; high-quality balance sheets and robust primary reception (jumbo prints clearing) underpin IG resilience.
    
*   **Rates/FX:** 10y UST ~4.09%, 2y ~3.61%, USD at a 3-month high, mildly restrictive but stable; spread beta to these moves remains low as long as vol stays contained.
    
*   **Commodities:** WTI ~$60 keeps inflation anxiety muted and cushions Energy IG; gold firmer is more a rates/FX tell than a credit one.
    

*   **Fair-value band:** **50–55 bp** remains the “carry equilibrium.”
    
*   **Path to the 40s:** Requires either softer labor + steady disinflation (pulling the first ’26 cuts forward) or another leg down in rate vol.
    
*   **What widens us:** A hawkish “skip” signal into December, a disorderly USD spike, or a sharp oil reversal >$70 that jars inflation expectations.
    

1.  **Fed speak & QT hints:** A cut without balance-sheet clarity could nudge OAS toward 55–58; explicit QT-endgame talk would likely richen spreads.
    
2.  **Equity breadth:** Persistent mega-cap narrowness is fine until it isn’t, credit will care only if it morphs into broad risk-off or funding stress.
    
3.  **Primary market tone:** Keep an eye on order multiples and concessions; any slippage there is the earliest, cleanest tell.
    

Credit’s calm persists. **IG OAS ~52 bp** says the market still believes in a slow-motion soft landing with plentiful liquidity. Expect **sideways-to-grind-tighter** price action inside **50–55 bp**, with dips toward **~55–58 bp** likely to be bought unless the Fed meaningfully re-prices the front end or equities’ pullback turns systemic. Carry remains king.
