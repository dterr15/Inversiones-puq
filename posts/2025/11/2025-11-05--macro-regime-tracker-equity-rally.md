_**The Macro Regime Tracker offers a daily lens on how shifts in growth, inflation, and liquidity affect short-term risk and reward. Leveraging machine learning, AI, and cross-asset data, it identifies macro changes and their impact on market positioning.**_

When we were at the equity lows last night, I published this report explaining that the driver of the selling pressure was from a positioning unwind as opposed to a macro driver. Why does this matter? Because when you understand WHERE the selling pressure is coming from (in this case, the carry trade), you can know if you want to buy the dip or derisk before further downside.

We continue to be in a macro regime where credit is getting pumped into the system but there are going to be significantly more risks to manage into the end of the year. As I laid out in this video, we are seeing unprecedented factors converge to create extreme outcomes. In other words, melt up and melt downs are a higher probability with macro volatility instead of a slow, safe grind.

All of these factors are setting the stage for much bigger forces to begin coming into play. Below are all the systematic models and strategies mapping the major macro changes across asset classes. More on this tomorrow.

_**The Macro Regime Model offers a real-time view of growth, inflation, and yield curve dynamics, integrating these with credit market shifts, equity risk premiums, and positioning data. It connects upcoming catalysts to statistical drivers of asset prices, creating a unified framework that quantifies skew and clarifies risk-reward across asset classes.**_

Dip-buyers stayed active even as ISM Services re-accelerated and 10s pushed ~7 bp higher to ~4.16%. The tape read the print as “growth > inflation scare,” with cyclicals and communications leadership offsetting a small Tech dip. Breadth improved, and weakness clustered in defensives and rate-sensitives.

**Weighted contribution (Index +0.36 pp)**  
Leaders: **Comm Svcs +0.16 pp**, **Cons Disc +0.09 pp**, **Industrials +0.05 pp**, **Health Care +0.06 pp**, **Financials +0.03 pp**  
Laggards/flat: **Info Tech −0.02 pp**, **Staples −0.02 pp**, RE/Utils ≈ 0, Energy/Materials ≈ 0

**Unweighted performance (breadth)**  
Leaders: **Comm Svcs +1.59%**, **Cons Disc +0.86%**, **Industrials +0.66%**, **Health Care +0.64%**  
Mid: **Financials/Materials +0.24%**, **Energy +0.10%**  
Laggards: **Info Tech −0.05%**, **Real Estate −0.24%**, **Staples −0.34%**, **Utilities −0.02%**

**Read:** Participation broadened beyond mega-cap Tech; cyclicals and services-heavy groups did the lifting while duration-sensitives lagged—textbook response to firmer growth + higher yields.

*   **Activity/Prices:** ISM Services **52.4** (8-month high) with **Prices Paid 70** (3-yr high). Demand firm; inflation signal warm but not regime-changing.
    
*   **Rates/Curve:** 10y ~**4.16%** in a modest bear-steepener; **rate vol contained**, letting equities digest higher yields.
    
*   **FX/Crypto:** USD little changed; **BTC +3.6% / ETH +7.3%**, risk tone constructive.
    
*   **Earnings/AI:** Semis leadership cooled at the margin vs yesterday’s pop; Tech small net drag while **Comm Svcs** and **Disc** carried beta.
    
*   **Positioning/Flows:** Still a **buy-the-dip** backdrop; systematic re-add + seasonal buybacks aid downside containment.
    

1.  **Growth > rates headwind:** Higher yields didn’t derail risk, cyclicals outperformed; defensives and RE/Utils lagged.
    
2.  **Leadership broadening:** Comm Svcs/Disc/Industrials/HC did the heavy lifting, healthier than a one-factor Tech tape.
    
3.  **Valuation still the governor:** With Tech a small drag, the index can still climb if breadth persists, but lofty multiples keep pullback risk alive on any earnings/guidance wobble.
    

*   **Reals & MOVE:** A reals-led rates pop with vol would hit long-duration growth and RE/Utils harder.
    
*   **Breadth follow-through:** Can Industrials/Financials maintain leadership if Tech chops sideways?
    
*   **Services-price persistence:** Another hot print would test the “cuts-ahead” narrative even if growth is firm.
    
*   **Consumer pulse:** Disc vs Staples spread—today’s risk-on tilt wants resilient spending.
    

A classic **“good data, higher yields, still green”** session: cyclicals and services leadership offset a mild Tech drag, leaving the S&P up **+0.36%** with better breadth. As long as **rate vol stays tame** and earnings breadth holds, dips remain buyable, though the mix (hot ISM prices, firm reals) argues for **cyclical over duration** on the margin and a wary eye on defensives and RE/Utilities

Spreads **tightened** alongside a broad equity rebound and hotter ISM services print. The tone was risk-positive, not euphoric, primary remains open, rates vol contained, and the market read the data as “growth confirmation” rather than a policy scare. Net: **carry intact**, beta modestly bid.

*   **IG OAS:** ~**52.8 bp** (last 52.751)
    
*   **5-yr average:** ~**61.9 bp** → ~9 bp inside
    
*   **Cycle tights:** ~**46.1 bp** → ~6–7 bp above
    
*   **2022 wides:** ~**111.2 bp** → ~58 bp tighter  
    We’re back toward the **lower half of the 50–55 bp equilibrium band**, flirting with the low-50s without threatening cycle tights.
    

*   **Data:** ISM Services **52.4** (8-month high); **Prices Paid 70** (3-year high). Demand re-accelerates; inflation signal warm but not disruptive.
    
*   **Rates:** 10y +7 bp to **~4.16%**; curve bear-steepened modestly. **MOVE muted** → spread beta can live with small rate back-ups when vol is contained.
    
*   **Equities/Flows:** >300 S&P advancers; **Semis +3%**, RTY +1.5%, a cleaner risk tone. Credit followed equities, not rates.
    
*   **FX/Crypto:** USD steady; **Bitcoin +3.6%**, risk appetite constructive at the margin.
    
*   **Energy/Commodities:** **WTI −1.6%** helps the disinflation narrative even as ISM prices run hot; benign for IG.
    

*   **Fair-value band:** **50–55 bp** still feels like “carry equilibrium.” At ~52.8 we’re near the **middle-low** of that range.
    
*   **Path to the 40s:** Needs a **disinflation + softer-labor** mix that drags reals lower and compresses rate vol further, plus steady primary.
    
*   **What pushes us back to 55–58:** A **rates-vol pop** (reals-led), a **broader equity drawdown** that dents new-issue demand, or unexpectedly **hawkish Fed** rhetoric.
    

*   **New issue**: books well-covered, concessions lean; refinancing windows open.
    
*   **Positioning**: Not stretched, room for incremental beta add if breadth persists. **Financials/Industrial** paper benefitting from improved cyclical tone.
    

*   **MOVE vs. real yields** (reals-led bear move matters more than nominal drift).
    
*   **Primary health**: order multiples/concessions/after-market.
    
*   **Earnings breadth & equity leadership**: if gains narrow back to mega-cap only, beta tightens less easily.
    
*   **ISM prices follow-through**: one print is fine; persistence would pressure reals.
    

1.  **“Good growth, tame vol”** is the sweet spot, today fit that script, so spreads tightened.
    
2.  **Carry remains king** inside 50–55; buyers showed up quickly after yesterday’s wobble.
    
3.  **Asymmetric risks** sit **above** current levels (a vol shock widens faster than a drift to the 40s).
    

IG reconfirmed its **resilience**, tightening with higher yields tells you the market sees **growth without stress**. Until rates vol bites or primary balks, **carry first, volatility later** remains the trade.
