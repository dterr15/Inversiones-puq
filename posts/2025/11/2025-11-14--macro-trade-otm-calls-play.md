**I want to maintain perspective about WHERE we are on a big picture basis. Geopolitical risk is ONLY going to increase over the next 5 years.**

There is a reason WHY $PLTR and gold have been rallying for years together: Everyone knows the degree of conflict and financial friction in the future will escalate as we move into the macro endgame.

This is THE idea that I explained in the recent geopolitical video: China is weaponizing its industrial base, currency, and exports in order to gain a strategic advantage over the world.

Naive optimists think that we should just let free markets be free markets. This all seems nice until they realize that China is hollowing out the German industrial base. What do you think is going to happen when China can exert leverage over Germany? You think they will use that leverage to help the US?

One of the problems of the modern age of quants is that there is ZERO thought given to how liquidity provision supports malicious actors. This is going to continue to compress volatility until things explode. This is already in the process of taking place.
