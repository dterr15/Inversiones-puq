After one of the most volatile weeks we’ve seen in a while, I’m going live today at market close for a deep-dive Q&A on what actually mattered and how I’m thinking about rates, equities, and Bitcoin from here.

I’ll be starting the livestream right at the close (in exactly 1 hour), and we’ll walk through:

*   The key moves behind this week’s rate volatility
    
*   How I’m framing risk and opportunity going into next week
    
*   Live Q&A for paid subscribers
    

This session is hosted on a **private livestream**.
