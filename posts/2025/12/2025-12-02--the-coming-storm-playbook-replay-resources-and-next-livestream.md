Hey everyone,

Thanks again to everyone who joined the livestream. This note will point you to the key resources from the “Preparing for the Storm” session and set expectations for what’s coming next.

If you want to revisit the core thesis and setup, start here:

*   **Macro Report: “A Storm Is Coming”**  
    Full write‑up of the structural liquidity risks from cross‑border flows and what can break under the surface.

*   **Video breakdown of the report**  
    Walkthrough of the logic, the mechanics, and why this risk window matters for actual portfolios.
    

From there, the “Preparing for the Storm” livestream (recording is linked below) focused on **implementation**:

*   Mapping portfolio exposures and where they can actually break
    
*   Building a path‑dependent decision tree instead of guessing in real time
    
*   Setting concrete signals, models, and a framework for action
    

The next livestream will build on that session and focus on the **actual TradingView models and processes** I use day‑to‑day:

1.  **TradingView model stack walkthrough**
    
    *   How I structure the models that map the macro regime and capital flows
        
    *   How each one is used in practice for sizing, timing, and risk
        
    *   How to assemble them into a **comprehensive, plug‑and‑play process** aligned with your own portfolio
        
2.  **Live build with my quant**
    
    *   You’ll see how he specifies and codes the indicators and dashboards we actually rely on
        
    *   You can propose ideas in the chat; we’ll select some and code them live so you see the full pipeline: idea → spec → code → model
        
3.  **Growing the shared tool library**
    
    *   Every useful model we build becomes part of the Capital Flows toolkit
        
    *   Over time, that gives the community an expanding set of tools to map the macro regime and flows, instead of everyone reinventing them in isolation
        
4.  By the end of this next session, Capital Flows Community members will walk away with an **exclusive suite of TradingView models** that I actually use to track the macro regime and capital flows.
    
    You’ll have a coherent set of tools you can plug into your own charts to:
    
    *   Map the current regime in real time
        
    *   See how flows, rates, and FX are shifting
        
    *   Tie those signals directly back into the risk and decision framework we built in the first webinar
        

My commitment: I’ll keep updating the research, models, and tools in real time as the regime evolves.  
Your side: stay plugged in, show up to these sessions, and actually run the process with your own constraints in mind.
