I recorded a new conversation with my friend Jared Kubin on something most people are ignoring right now

How AI actually changes risk, factor moves, and how to quantify it instead of guessing.

In the interview, we cover:

*   The real AI risks that matter for portfolio construction (and what’s noise)
    
*   How to think about factor moves in a regime where AI is driving dispersion
    
*   The exact tool to use in order to quantify these moves, and why I trust it
    
    *   Follow Jared here: [LINK](https://x.com/JaredKubin) and map all the most important factors here: [LINK](https://www.liquidationnation.ai/)
        

All of these points connect to the larger risks building under the surface that I covered in the livestream yesterday. You can find the recording and the entire playbook below.

Yesterday, I did a longer livestream walking through my broader interest rate framework and how I’m positioning around current dollar liquidity risks that building. Linked here:

The next livestream will build on that session and focus on the **actual TradingView models and processes** I use day‑to‑day:

1.  **TradingView model stack walkthrough**
    
    *   How I structure the models that map the macro regime and capital flows
        
    *   How each one is used in practice for sizing, timing, and risk
        
    *   How to assemble them into a **comprehensive, plug‑and‑play process** aligned with your own portfolio
        
2.  **Live build with my quant**
    
    *   You’ll see how he specifies and codes the indicators and dashboards we actually rely on
        
    *   You can propose ideas in the chat; we’ll select some and code them live so you see the full pipeline: idea → spec → code → model
        
3.  **Growing the shared tool library**
    
    *   Every useful model we build becomes part of the Capital Flows toolkit
        
    *   Over time, that gives the community an expanding set of tools to map the macro regime and flows, instead of everyone reinventing them in isolation
        
4.  By the end of this next session, Capital Flows Community members will walk away with an **exclusive suite of TradingView models** that I actually use to track the macro regime and capital flows.
    
    You’ll have a coherent set of tools you can plug into your own charts to:
    
    *   Map the current regime in real time
        
    *   See how flows, rates, and FX are shifting
        
    *   Tie those signals directly back into the risk and decision framework we built in the first webinar
        

Tomorrow’s webinar link is on the bottom page of this report (Thursday, December 4th, at 1 pm EST):

My commitment: I’ll keep updating the research, models, and tools in real time as the regime evolves.  
Your side: stay plugged in, show up to these sessions, and actually run the process with your own constraints in mind.
