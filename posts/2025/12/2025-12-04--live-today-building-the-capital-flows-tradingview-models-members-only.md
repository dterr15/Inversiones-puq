Quick reminder: **today we’re live, taking the macro playbook into actual TradingView and Python models.**

**Session details**

*   **Topic:** From playbook ([LINK](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/the-coming-storm-playbook-replay)) → live TradingView/Python models
    
*   **When:** Today at 1pm EST
    
*   **Where:** Private livestream for Capital Flows paying members (linked below)
    

**1\. TradingView model stack walkthrough**

*   How I structure the models that map the macro regime and capital flows
    
*   How each is used in practice for **sizing, timing, and risk**
    
*   How to assemble them into a **coherent, plug‑and‑play process** for your own portfolio
    

**2\. Live build with my quant**

*   You’ll see how he **specifies and codes** the indicators and dashboards we actually rely on
    
*   You can propose ideas in the chat; we’ll pull some, spec them, **code them live**, and plug them into the stack (idea → spec → code → model)
    

**3\. Growing the shared tool library**

*   Every useful model we build becomes part of the **Capital Flows toolkit**
    
*   Over time, that gives members an expanding set of tools to map macro regimes and flows, instead of everyone reinventing them alone
    

By the end of this session, **Capital Flows Community members** will walk away with an **exclusive suite of TradingView models** that I actually use to:

*   Map the current macro regime in real time
    
*   See how flows, rates, and FX are shifting
    
*   Tie those signals directly back into the **risk and decision framework** from the first webinar
