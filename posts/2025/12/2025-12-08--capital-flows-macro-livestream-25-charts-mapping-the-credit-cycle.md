I’m hosting a **live macro session** today at 6 pm EST

In this session, we’ll walk through **25 of the most important macro charts right now** and use them to build a **single, coherent roadmap** for the next 3–12 months across:

*   Growth and inflation
    
*   Yield curves and term premia
    
*   Liquidity and funding
    
*   FX and risk assets
    

The goal is simple:  
You leave with a **clear, rate‑driven macro framework** you can refer back to, instead of stitching together random threads and headlines.

Here is the link to the livestream:

If you want to go deeper than this session, I’ve organized all my past strategy breakdowns and notes into **the educational primers** so you can work through the full macro and rates framework step by step.

Hit the link to get instant access to the educational primers and start going through them in order after this call.
