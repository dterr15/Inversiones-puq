For most of financial history, **information was scarce and slow-moving.**

If you were closer to the data or the decision-makers, you had the edge. Everyone else waited for the morning note or tomorrow’s paper.

Today, we’re in the opposite world:

*   Information is **instant and infinite**
    
*   Everyone sees the same headlines at the same time
    
*   The constraint is no longer access, it’s **interpretation**
    

In this environment, edge comes from being at **the right place, at the right time, with the right information and framework** to act on it.

Tomorrow, **Friday, December 12 at 11am EST**, I’m hosting a live session.

In ~60 minutes, we’ll cover:

*   How the shift from **scarce, slow information** to **abundant, fast information** has changed where edge actually lives
    
*   Why “more data” without a macro framework just adds noise and false confidence
    
*   How a **top-down macro view** lets you lock into your specific edge, instead of chasing every narrative and headline
    

This is a **no-cost, live research briefing** for PMs, strategists, CIOs, and serious macro/rates practitioners.

At the end, I’ll open invitations to a **closed-door working webinar on Saturday morning, December 13 at 11am EST**.

In that smaller session, we’ll:

*   Build a **practical macro + influence framework** you can plug into your existing process
    
*   Map where _your_ information flow and positioning edge actually are
    
*   Work through implementation and Q&A with a small group
    

If you want a clearer top-down map for navigating an age of information overload, start by joining tomorrow’s session.

_If all you do is attend the free session, you’ll walk away with a clearer top‑down map of how influence and information are moving capital right now._

_But the reality is: **edge isn’t a one‑off event.**_

_We’re in an environment where narratives, policy expectations, and positioning can all shift inside a week. To keep an edge, you don’t just need a framework; you need a place where that framework is **updated, stress‑tested, and applied in real time.**_

_That’s why I built the **Capital Flows Community.**_
