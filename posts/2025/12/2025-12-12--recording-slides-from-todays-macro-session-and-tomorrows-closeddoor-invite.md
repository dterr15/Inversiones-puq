Today’s session was about one core idea:

> _In a world of infinite, instant information, edge comes from interpretation and implementation, not access._

We walked through how narrative warfare, policy expectations, and flows are shaping **where capital can and cannot go**, and how a top‑down macro + influence framework helps you sort signal from noise instead of reacting to every headline.

Tomorrow, I want to take that one step further.

Tomorrow (Saturday, December 13 at 11am EST), I’m hosting a smaller, **closed‑door working webinar** for paid Capital Flows subscribers.

In that session, we will:

*   **Turn today’s framework into a working map** you can plug into your actual book / process
    
*   **Identify where your information and positioning edge realistically lives** (given your mandate, constraints, and time horizon)
    
*   **Work through implementation and Q&A** with a small group, so you leave with specific actions, not just ideas
    

This is not a repeat of today. Think of today as the **theory and structure**, tomorrow as **application and calibration**.

To attend tomorrow’s closed‑door session, you need to be a **paid subscriber** by **tonight at 11:59pm EST**:

As a paid subscriber, you’ll get:

*   Access to **tomorrow’s closed‑door webinar + recording**
    
*   The full archive of **macro reports, dashboards, and strategy notes**
    
*   Ongoing **updates to the macro + influence framework** as conditions change
    

If you’ve been on the fence, this is the cleanest test: upgrade, join us tomorrow, go through a full working session, and decide if having this level of structure and interpretation around macro and flows is worth it for your process.

If all you do is watch today’s replay, you’ll have a clearer map of how influence and information are moving capital right now.

If you join tomorrow’s session as a paid subscriber, you’ll leave with that map **wired into how you actually allocate and manage risk.**
