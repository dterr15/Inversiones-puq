I just recorded a new episode of the podcast with Brent Donnelly, one of the sharpest FX traders and macro thinkers in the game. We dig into how major central bank moves, rate differentials, and positioning are driving FX right now, and what that actually means for trade construction and risk in the months ahead.

If you care about the intersection of macro and FX strategy, this one is worth your time.

I would encourage you to follow Brent on twitter ([LINK](https://x.com/donnelly_brent)) and subscribe to his research at Spectra Markets ([LINK](https://www.spectramarkets.com/))

If you want to go deeper than this conversation and really connect macro, geopolitics, and FX, I also just released the recordings from this weekend’s two-part webinar series:

1.  **The Battle for Influence and Capital: How Modern Information Flows Shapes Global Capital Flows**
    
2.  **Operating in the Information Arena: A Redundancy Playbook for Geopolitics and Macro Risk**
    

Both sessions come with the full slide decks and are designed to help you build a more robust information process and risk framework around macro and FX. You can watch the replays and access the materials here:
