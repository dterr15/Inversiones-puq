_The most dangerous thing you can do going into 2026 is run a “slightly updated” version of your 2025 playbook._

_2025 trained a lot of smart people to do the wrong things for the next phase of the credit cycle: it rewarded a specific mix of rate expectations, liquidity assumptions, and positioning that will not be there for you next year._

_In the video below, I walk through why the 2026 credit cycle is likely to behave differently from both:_

*   _the last 15 years **and**_
    
*   _the playbook that worked in 2025_
    

_and what that implies for anyone actually sizing risk rather than just having macro opinions._

_If you allocate capital for yourself or others and you’re planning into 2026, this is worth 20 minutes of your time._

_If this raised some uncomfortable questions about how you’re set up for 2026, that’s intentional._
