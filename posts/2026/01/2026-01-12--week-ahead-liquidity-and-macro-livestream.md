> “All money that is anywhere has to come from somewhere”

That is a fundamental presupposition for HOW the flows of capital function in the system.

When I dont understand WHY something is happening in markets, I always start by breaking down all of the **sources and destinations of liquidity.** When you map these, you can see how capital flows between different assets.

Here is the thing that confuses people, though: the flows of capital are never evenly distributed through time. This is where the historic phrase, “There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen,” comes from.

We are in a short period of time where decades are happening.

I want to draw your attention to a very specific SOURCE of liquidity that is shifting the amount of global liquidity int he system, JAPAN.

I put out a short note for paid subscribers yesterday explaining how Japan is one of the main drivers of liquidity as opposed to the labor market print: It was the fiscal news out of Japan, not NFP, that was driving flows.

Why does this matter? Because the SOURCE of liquidity explains short-term divergences like this, where the Nikkei is holding its bid as ES pulls back marginally on an intraday basis.

Does it begin to make more sense why gold and silver are up right now during the overnight session during this divergence? The liquidity is coming from Japan, which is bidding for gold and silver. This was one of the main drivers I explained in the livestream last week (Full slide deck and recording: [LINK](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/regime-shift-in-japan-the-melt-up))

Until China stops its trade war, Japan stops its fiscal spending, or the Fed stops cutting, gold and silver are likely to continue melting up. Will there be pull-backs and positioning unwinds? Sure, but the larger structural drivers are always going to be the signal amid the noise.

If you want to understand these structural forces, I’ll be doing a live session tomorrow at 3:30 p.m. Eastern, starting 30 minutes before the U.S. cash close. I’ll walk through the structural drivers behind gold and silver, why this melt‑up is happening, and exactly how to manage position risk during pullbacks or when price looks “overbought.” If you want a clear, actionable playbook instead of guessing at headlines, join the livestream via the link in this note.

On top of the livestream, here are all the catalysts I am watching this week, and I will walk you through them in real-time in the chat function here on Substack.

This week is shaped by two things: (1) the US inflation/growth stack (CPI, retail sales/PPI, claims/soft data), and (2) US Treasury auctions plus a dense run of bank earnings. If markets are already leaning one way (rates/risk), this is the kind of week that can either validate the narrative or force a rethink or repricing.

*   US CPI (Tue) is the anchor print for rates, USD, and FI duration. A clean downside surprise will see release more real-rate pressure and supports risk assets. A sticky print re-prices the front end and drags long-duration.
    
*   US retail sales + PPI (Wed), retail sales is the a growth check, PPI helps validate (or undermine) the CPI impulse.
    
*   Claims + regional surveys(Thu) are the cross-currents with labour cooling vs resilience
