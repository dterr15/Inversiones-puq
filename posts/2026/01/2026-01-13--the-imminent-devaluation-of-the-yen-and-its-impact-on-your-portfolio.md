Most investors still think of “yen risk” as an FX sideshow. It isn’t. When a core funding currency of the system moves, it reshapes the entire global risk curve: who can lever, what counts as safe collateral, and how quickly liquidity vanishes when everyone scrambles for the exit. In this video, I walk through why the yen is set up for a potential devaluation and how that kind of shift transmits into your portfolio even if you never trade a single FX pair.

If you want to go deeper into the bigger‑picture macro forces behind this, I’ve added the full recording of yesterday’s livestream plus the slide deck. That session walks through the broader regime, credit cycle dynamics, and global liquidity backdrop that sit behind the yen story and link it to the rest of your portfolio.

If you’re an active risk taker and want the full mechanics rather than the 30,000‑foot story, read the previous macro report I wrote on this setup. It walks through the plumbing: how funding, balance sheets, and the credit cycle interact with a potential yen devaluation, and what that implies for sizing, hedging, and where you sit on the global risk curve. If you’re putting real capital at risk, that’s the piece you should study.
