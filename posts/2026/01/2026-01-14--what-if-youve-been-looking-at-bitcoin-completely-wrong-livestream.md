I’m hosting a live, full‑stack breakdown on how to actually understand and trade Bitcoin. We’ll go from ‘number go up’ memes to a clear, macro‑driven framework you can use to size risk, time entries, and avoid getting blown out by regime shifts.

**For one session, I want you to stop listening to what everyone else says Bitcoin is and let Bitcoin speak for itself – through its price, its flows, and its behavior.** That’s the only way to respect what ‘decentralized’ really means. **At the end of the stream, I’ll walk you through the single biggest macro and crypto trade I’m putting on right now, in detail.**

Livestream starts at 3pm EST:

Here is an educational primer on how to understand Bitcoin from a first principles perspective, instead of injecting all the noise from narratives. If you want to prepare for the livestream, read this!
