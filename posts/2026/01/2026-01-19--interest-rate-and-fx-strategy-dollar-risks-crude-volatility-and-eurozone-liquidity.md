Over the last two weeks, I recorded three short videos walking through how I see the macro regime evolving and what that means for rates, FX, and equities. Those videos went out in real time, but they’re the right starting point for understanding the week ahead, so I’ve pulled them together for you here in front of the paywall.

Think of them as the “pre‑game”: how policy, liquidity, and the cycle have been shifting, why that matters for risk assets, and the key levels and dynamics I’m watching.

Below the paywall is the full written Week Ahead report:

*   how I’m updating the macro map based on the latest data,
    
*   where I see the balance of risk across rates, credit, and equities now,
    
*   and the specific positioning implications for the coming week.
    

If you just want the big picture, the three videos will get you there. If you want the full playbook I’m using to make allocation decisions this week, it’s in the report that follows.
