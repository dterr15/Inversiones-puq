Here’s the replay of the livestream on the credit cycle and the macro “endgame.”

In the session, I walked through how credit cycles actually progress, what typically breaks at each stage, and the set of paths that are still open from here. The goal is simple: give you a clear, actionable map so you’re not guessing which regime you’re trading or investing into.

Below the video you’ll find the slide deck and the Credit Cycle PDF so you can work through the framework at your own pace or revisit specific sections.

For paid subscribers, I’ve added a full written report below the paywall that applies this framework to today’s data and lays out the key scenarios, positioning implications, and risks I’m focused on now.
