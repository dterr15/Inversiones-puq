The credit cycle is doing exactly what it always does at this stage: compressing a lot of future pain into a narrow window. In this video, I walk through every key chart so you can see why I don’t think this ends well, and what that means for anyone running real risk.

_If you want to see how I’m turning this into concrete rate, credit, and equity decisions in real time, that session is where I’ll lay it out._
