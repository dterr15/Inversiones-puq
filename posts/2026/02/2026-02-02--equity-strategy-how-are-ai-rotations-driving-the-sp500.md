As we head into a new week, it’s essential to understand WHY macro changes are happening, not just that they’re happening. Buying and selling pressure constantly flows through asset classes, and making sense of these moves requires the right context. Right now, the biggest question is how the new Fed chair will reshape equity market rotations across AI, interest rates, and global FX.

Are we witnessing a rotation or a risk-off environment in the S&P500?

And how does the new Fed chair factor into positioning for major trades? That’s exactly what I’ll be breaking down in today’s report for paid subscribers.

I laid the groundwork for this analysis in Saturday’s livestream for paid subscribers. We’re setting up for a larger macro bet that takes advantage of multiple converging factors.

If you missed the livestream, the recording is available at the bottom of this report along with the accompanying slide deck. Use these resources to integrate this framework into your redundancy planning and risk management.

This is going to matter because we’re at a point where macro forces and equity rotations are converging to create clear trade setups.
