My goal in markets is very simple: stay on the right side of the macro regime and take big bets.

If you can consistently map the macro regime and develop a base of knowledge over time, the big bets will find you.

We are seeing significant rotations in risk assets (read this if you’re trying to understand these risks: [LINK](https://www.capitalflowsresearch.com/p/equity-strategy-how-are-ai-rotations)), which means you can’t blindly buy beta with leverage and hope for the best; you actually have to pick your spots.

[PURR 0.00%↑](https://substack.com/discover/stocks/PURR) is THE spot I have laid out for paid subscribers, and it continues to be my biggest bet. If you are a paid subscriber on here, you get all of the real time updates and analysis on how I am mapping the regime and taking these bets. The key is developing these bets with foresight, not in retrospect.

This is the original report that I wrote on HYPE and PURR. What I want to do today is update you about some very important changes that are shifting HOW I think about the trade.

There are two significant gaps in how the market understands Hyperliquid and Hyperliquid-based strategies. Understanding both of them is the key to framing when short-term tops and bottoms occur.
